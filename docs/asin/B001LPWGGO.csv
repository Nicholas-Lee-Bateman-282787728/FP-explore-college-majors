1215609,A3C9UDU6XQQ70Q,B001LPWGGO,Canuck in WA,"[0, 0]","Reason I say this, is at the time when the Islanders were in the midst of their dynasty, I really was too young to appreciate just what kind of character, makeup and class this team truly had.  Now that I am in my late 40's and was able to reminisce on some of these games that I saw growing up, I can not only truly appreciate just what kind of team that Bill Torrey and Al Arbour built during this time period, but also, how they handled success in such a classy manner.For my personal opinion, the two top games that stand out for me are 1) Game 5 between the Islanders & Pens in 1982, where the Isles came SOOOOO close to getting their dynasty derailed.  Late in the third period, you honestly feel that there is no way that they will win this thing (suspension of reality), and yet, you are awed at how someone such as John Tonelli continuously comes up big in the clutch.  The second game I highly recommend is the Game 5 encounter between the Rangers and Isles in the 84 playoffs.  And even though the Isles failed to win a 5th cup that year, this game to me is honestly what hockey is all about from a number of viewpoints.  It is fast, hard hitting, nail biting up and down action, no cheap shots, but best of all, CBC does the game, and there is truly something special about hearing Dick Irvin call a game.  Don Cherry also provides color commentary, and a again, this is at a time when having Don in the booth was an absolute joy to listen to as he provides so much insight and analysis that means so much during the game.  I can honestly say that since purchasing this DVD, I must have watched this game over and over about 5 times now, and never get bored of it.  And again, it is all a matter of choice and preference, but to me, taken at all angles (TV coverage, rivalry, players involved, coaches involved, storyline (4 time cup winners vs. the ""Broadway Blues"" who havent won a cup since '40), this is the perfect game.Other games in the set, I find a bit boring (at times) such as the one versus Vancouver and Minnesota as cup clinchers, but again, if you're a hockey afficianado such as myself, you look beyond just the score and appreciate the technically fundamental soundness of each of the players on that squad . .How Goring busts his hump on every shift, how the Sutter brothers always give 100%, how Tonelli is such a battler in the corners and never seems to be denied the puck when he has to battle for one against an opponent (J. To, you are the MAN!), and finally, just how talented Bryan Trottier truly is.  After watching this, I can honestly agree with Mike Bossy when he said the ""controversial comment"" of how ""Trotier was more talented than Gretzky."" . If you look at an all around game and see just how Trottier plays both ends of the rink, most knowledgable hockey fans would come to the same conclusion.My recommendation is to buy this DVD if you truly appreciate the beauty of a team that can play all facets of the game, and knows how to do it in a class manner.  Again, at no time did I ever consider myself an Islanders fan growing up, so this review is not from some hometown ""Homer"" whose team can do no wrong.  It is simply and assessment from someone who bought the video and can appreciate one of the greatest dynasties in not only hockey, but in sports history, to have ever come along.",5,"Even if you're not an Islanders fan, buy this DVD",1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,3336,"['Reason', 'say', 'time', 'when', 'Islanders', 'were', 'midst', 'dynasty', 'really', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'appreciate', 'just', 'what', 'kind', 'character', 'makeup', 'class', 'team', 'truly', 'had', 'Now', 'am', 'late', '40', 'was', 'able', 'reminisce', 'games', 'saw', 'growing', 'up', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'just', 'what', 'kind', 'team', 'Bill', 'Torrey', 'Al', 'Arbour', 'built', 'time', 'period', 'also', 'how', 'handled', 'success', 'such', 'classy', 'manner.For', 'personal', 'opinion', 'two', 'top', 'games', 'stand', 'out', 'are', '1', 'Game', '5', 'Islanders', 'Pens', '1982', 'where', 'Isles', 'came', 'SOOOOO', 'close', 'getting', 'dynasty', 'derailed', 'Late', 'third', 'period', 'honestly', 'feel', 'way', 'will', 'win', 'thing', 'suspension', 'reality', 'yet', 'are', 'awed', 'how', 'someone', 'such', 'John', 'Tonelli', 'continuously', 'up', 'big', 'clutch', 'second', 'game', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Game', '5', 'encounter', 'Rangers', 'Isles', '84', 'playoffs', 'even', 'Isles', 'failed', 'win', '5th', 'cup', 'year', 'game', 'honestly', 'what', 'hockey', 'number', 'viewpoints', 'fast', 'hard', 'hitting', 'nail', 'biting', 'up', 'action', 'cheap', 'shots', 'best', 'CBC', 'game', 'truly', 'something', 'special', 'hearing', 'Dick', 'Irvin', 'call', 'game', 'Don', 'Cherry', 'also', 'color', 'commentary', 'again', 'time', 'when', 'having', 'Don', 'booth', 'was', 'absolute', 'joy', 'listen', 'so', 'much', 'insight', 'analysis', 'so', 'much', 'game', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'game', 'about', '5', 'times', 'now', 'never', 'get', 'bored', 'again', 'matter', 'choice', 'preference', 'taken', 'angles', 'TV', 'coverage', 'rivalry', 'players', 'involved', 'coaches', 'involved', 'storyline', '4', 'time', 'cup', 'winners', 'vs.', 'Broadway', 'Blues', 'who', 'havent', 'won', 'cup', ""'40"", 'perfect', 'game.Other', 'games', 'set', 'find', 'bit', 'boring', 'times', 'such', 'one', 'versus', 'Vancouver', 'Minnesota', 'cup', 'clinchers', 'again', ""'re"", 'hockey', 'afficianado', 'such', 'look', 'just', 'score', 'appreciate', 'technically', 'fundamental', 'soundness', 'players', 'squad', 'Goring', 'busts', 'hump', 'shift', 'how', 'Sutter', 'brothers', 'always', 'give', '100', '%', 'how', 'Tonelli', 'such', 'battler', 'corners', 'never', 'be', 'denied', 'puck', 'when', 'battle', 'one', 'opponent', 'J', 'are', 'MAN', 'finally', 'just', 'how', 'talented', 'Bryan', 'Trottier', 'truly', 'watching', 'can', 'honestly', 'agree', 'Mike', 'Bossy', 'when', 'said', 'controversial', 'comment', 'how', 'Trotier', 'was', 'more', 'talented', 'Gretzky', 'look', 'game', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'Trottier', 'ends', 'rink', 'most', 'knowledgable', 'hockey', 'fans', 'would', 'come', 'same', 'conclusion.My', 'recommendation', 'buy', 'DVD', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'team', 'can', 'play', 'facets', 'game', 'how', 'do', 'class', 'manner', 'Again', 'time', 'did', 'ever', 'consider', 'Islanders', 'fan', 'growing', 'up', 'review', 'not', 'hometown', 'Homer', 'team', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'simply', 'assessment', 'someone', 'who', 'bought', 'video', 'can', 'appreciate', 'one', 'greatest', 'dynasties', 'not', 'only', 'hockey', 'sports', 'history', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'along']",NHL: New York Islanders 10 Greatest Games

In fact, the Isles were the reason I started playing hockey at a time when no one else in my family knew what hockey was.  The Isles have brought me great joy and pain since I was 6 years old, and this is a great way to re-live the great times.I have had many of these games on VHS, but as we all know tape degrades.  I can finally have a permanent record of these great moments.  I agree with everyone who remarked about the video quality, but please remember that many of these games are pretty old.

1215615,A1VSIAXJ11B2KS,B001LPWGGO,R. F. Mojica,"[16, 16]","As someone who grew up in New York and has watched the Islanders from almost their first game in 1972, I thought this was a good but not great set with a fair selection of games. Of course  disputes are inevitable in any ""10 greatest"" list, but my objections are:The Islanders first big playoff push was in 1975, and there should have been at least one game from that year. The preferred games would be game 3 vs. the Rangers or game 7 vs. Pittsburgh. As I have never seen anything but short clips from these game since I saw them (or heard them on the radio)  live when they were played, I don't know that they still exist in complete form. They probably don't. I'm pretty sure nothing remains from the Rangers series but a 15 second clip of JP Parise's game 3 OT goal. If they don't,  some game from the Philadelphia series should be included. I have seen full game videos from this series and the absence of a 1975 playoff game is the most serious flaw in this set.The second missing essential game is the winning streak record breaker vs. the Colorado Rockies. I was at that game in person and not only was it historic, it was a thrilling match with a wild finish. It's a crime this game wasn't included. Their winning streak record has since been broken, but when the Islander won their 15th straight, the record they erased went back to 1929 & it was a big deal.For the more recent selections, I think it was right to include one game from the '02 series vs. Toronto, because that was one of the best, most intense early round playoff series I've ever seen. But they picked the wrong game. Game 6 was the best single playoff game the Islanders have had since their Stanley Cup years. This was the game after Michael Peca was injured on Darcy Tucker's cheap shot & the Isles were out for revenge & got it, at least temporarily. There were no penalty shots, but penalty shots are very overrated to this hockey fan, especially in comparison to a nasty 60 minute contest between two teams that hated each other.In order to get these three games in, I'd drop the Al Arbour game & the Volek OT game & exchange game 6 in the Toronto series for game 4. The Al Arbour game was fun, but compared to games in the past when this team was winning cups, it falls short. I got the idea they included it because they wanted something recent for a team that has had little success in 20 years. Dropping the Volek game is a hard choice, but it was really a dead end for the Islanders while a '75 playoff game and the game vs. Colorado were of historic significance. There's one last game I'd like to see that goes way back in NYI history. In their first year, 1972-73, they played a wild game vs. the defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins which they won I believe 9-7. This game was a fantastic result because the Islander won only 12 games that year and that one of them was vs. the great Bobby Orr Bruins, and that it was a 9-7 game made it one of the most unlikely occurrences in NHL history. I've seen some video of this game & if the entire game exists in video form, that it wasn't included in this set shows the lack of perspective suffered by those who put the set together. I'd like to give this set 3 1/2 stars coz it's better than 3 but not as good as 4, but I'll be generous. If it included at least one 1975 playoff game, I would give it five stars, but completely missing that truly important year is a bad flaw for a set like this.",4,"Good, But Missing Some Games",1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,3441,"['someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'watched', 'Islanders', 'almost', 'first', 'game', '1972', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'set', 'fair', 'selection', 'games', 'course', 'disputes', 'are', 'inevitable', '10', 'greatest', 'list', 'objections', 'are', 'Islanders', 'first', 'big', 'playoff', 'push', 'was', '1975', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'one', 'game', 'year', 'preferred', 'games', 'would', 'be', 'game', '3', 'Rangers', 'game', '7', 'vs.', 'Pittsburgh', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'short', 'clips', 'game', 'saw', 'heard', 'radio', 'live', 'when', 'were', 'played', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'still', 'exist', 'complete', 'form', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'nothing', 'Rangers', 'series', '15', 'second', 'clip', 'JP', 'Parise', 'game', '3', 'OT', 'goal', 'do', ""n't"", 'game', 'Philadelphia', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'included', 'have', 'seen', 'full', 'game', 'videos', 'series', 'absence', '1975', 'playoff', 'game', 'most', 'serious', 'flaw', 'set.The', 'second', 'missing', 'essential', 'game', 'winning', 'streak', 'record', 'breaker', 'Colorado', 'Rockies', 'was', 'game', 'person', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'historic', 'was', 'thrilling', 'match', 'wild', 'finish', 'crime', 'game', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'winning', 'streak', 'record', 'been', 'broken', 'when', 'Islander', 'won', '15th', 'straight', 'record', 'erased', 'went', 'back', '1929', 'was', 'big', 'deal.For', 'more', 'recent', 'selections', 'think', 'was', 'right', 'include', 'one', 'game', ""'02"", 'series', 'vs.', 'Toronto', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'intense', 'early', 'round', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'picked', 'wrong', 'game', 'Game', '6', 'was', 'best', 'single', 'playoff', 'game', 'Islanders', 'have', 'had', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'years', 'was', 'game', 'Michael', 'Peca', 'was', 'injured', 'Darcy', 'Tucker', 'cheap', 'shot', 'Isles', 'were', 'out', 'revenge', 'got', 'least', 'temporarily', 'were', 'penalty', 'shots', 'penalty', 'shots', 'are', 'very', 'overrated', 'hockey', 'fan', 'especially', 'comparison', 'nasty', '60', 'minute', 'contest', 'two', 'teams', 'hated', 'other.In', 'order', 'get', 'three', 'games', ""'d"", 'drop', 'Al', 'Arbour', 'game', 'Volek', 'OT', 'game', 'exchange', 'game', '6', 'Toronto', 'series', 'game', '4', 'Al', 'Arbour', 'game', 'was', 'fun', 'compared', 'games', 'past', 'when', 'team', 'was', 'winning', 'cups', 'short', 'got', 'idea', 'included', 'wanted', 'something', 'recent', 'team', 'had', 'little', 'success', '20', 'years', 'Dropping', 'Volek', 'game', 'hard', 'choice', 'was', 'really', 'dead', 'end', 'Islanders', ""'75"", 'playoff', 'game', 'game', 'vs.', 'Colorado', 'were', 'historic', 'significance', 'one', 'last', 'game', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'way', 'back', 'NYI', 'history', 'first', 'year', '1972-73', 'played', 'wild', 'game', 'defending', 'Stanley', 'Cup', 'champion', 'Boston', 'Bruins', 'won', 'believe', '9-7', 'game', 'was', 'fantastic', 'result', 'Islander', 'won', 'only', '12', 'games', 'year', 'one', 'was', 'great', 'Bobby', 'Orr', 'Bruins', 'was', '9-7', 'game', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'unlikely', 'occurrences', 'NHL', 'history', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'video', 'game', 'entire', 'game', 'video', 'form', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'set', 'lack', 'perspective', 'suffered', 'who', 'put', 'set', 'together', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', 'set', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'coz', 'better', '3', 'not', 'as', 'good', '4', ""'ll"", 'be', 'generous', 'included', 'least', 'one', '1975', 'playoff', 'game', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'completely', 'missing', 'truly', 'important', 'year', 'bad', 'flaw', 'set']",NHL: New York Islanders 10 Greatest Games
