But you watch the second (Hurricane) and realize that yes, it is possible to make an even worse movie than Virus. But boy oh boy, when you get to number 3 (Deadly Harvest) you realize that the impossible has been made manifest! It is also stunningly awful!In short (the films aren't worth more than that), the productions are cheap and sleazy, the actors are off their feed (if indeed, they'd eaten from the apple of talent at all), the settings are lousy, most of the footage is stock footage, and some shots are even repeated. The scores match all of this in quality. But the DVD presentation equals the worst I have seen on the medium (a cheapo early DVD of Metropolus, where all the subtitles were trimmed off left and right).
