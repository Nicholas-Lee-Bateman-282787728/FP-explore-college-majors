""Perhaps we can see it again next year. Thanks for showing this to me."" What were those teary eyes about?It was about a young mom, Martha Evans (played by Kristy Swanson) with three kids who are abandoned by her sleazy husband who adds insult to injury by cleaning out their savings before he takes off. She packs up the kids in search of a future, landing in a town that lies in the middle of nowhere, unable to afford even the price of a motel room, with barely a few weeks until Christmas.Martha's luck begins to change ever so slowly when the motel owner (played by Mike Hagerty) let's her have a motel room without cash in advance. Tess Harper (played by Trudy Williams) gives her a job at her diner, where, lo' and behold' she runs into the local police officer K.C. Clyde (played by Joe Hopkins), who can barely order a smittenburger on whiskey to stay. She finds a babysitter, and a local pastor willing to find her a more permanent home. Edward Hermann is the local grouch without a kind word for anyone except the beautiful and vivacious Martha and her step son, the son of the dadgrinch who stole their Christmas. A Christian theme permeates the movie but is not overdone.Debbie obviously loved the movie, and I bow to her tastes and judgment if I don't want to be denied everything except a bucket of coal this holly, jolly Christmas. I was bored with this by the first 14 minutes. For me, there was no suspense on what the ending would be. I did enjoy seeing Mike Haggerty and Edward Hermann reunited in this film.

1460312,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005GP7EUI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","So here's another holiday picture that celebrates the values of Smalltown, America, and you can't hate on that. In A CHRISTMAS WISH Kristy Swanson plays the destitute Martha Evans (Kristy Swanson), mother of three, abandoned by her deadbeat husband but not before he'd drained her bank account. Unable to afford their home Martha and the kids drive north, haphazardly. Martha is scared to death and trying to comfort her children and desperately crossing her fingers. In the tiny town of Mapleton she lands a beyond minimum wage job as a waitress at the local diner. This is when their new lives begin.Some folks may grouch that the narrative plods along and that nothing major happens, and that's fine. A CHRISTMAS WISH, which first aired in 2011 on the Hallmark Channel, relies on its small moments of triumph. If you end up seeing this movie, you may be inspired by Martha's perseverance, given that her world had just crumbled. Kristy Swanson is terrific here. She isn't heroic like when she played Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She's heroic in ways that are more relatable. I love how untiring Martha is in her kind treatment of the children, two of whom aren't biologically her own.And that's another strength of the film, how good the kid actors are. Kevin Lee Herring III plays the troubled step-son Miles, stricken with a stammer and often bullied in school. The adorable award goes to the three-year-old wrecking ball Lily (Lilee Clyde?). Lily is referred to as ""the ninja baby"" for her knack of wreaking havoc without anyone noticing until it's too late. But if anyone can steal the ninja baby's thunder, it's sweet Mel (Kirstin Dorn), the family's ""little believer."" Maybe the biggest reason I like this film is its sensitive portrayal of a child's enduring faith. Kirstin Dorn is marvelous.So, no, there aren't sensational, sweeping gestures, not as such. Instead we witness a mother's unflagging love for her children and how, when times were at last at their bleakest, she's rewarded by a community pulling together. The supporting cast is solid, with special mention reserved for Tess Harper as the kindly diner owner who gives Martha a chance and Edward Herrman as the cantankerous old man with, you guessed it, a heart of gold. A CHRISTMAS WISH is a low-key slice of life, given luster by virtue of a sensitive treatment and the cast's grounded performances.

This guy is the classic case of irresponsible males.  He empties their bank accounts and leaves with most of their money, deserting his wife, her two daughters and a step son, to survive on their own.  Martha, who is unable to earn enough to support the family, loads up the children and moves north in hope of a better life..After traveling a log distance, Martha stops at a small town, finds an inexpensive room and secures a job as a waitress in a small 24 hour caf&eacute;.  She struggles for days, cares for the children, and makes friends.  Meanwhile the children grieve the abandonment by their father and wonder if that means they are not loved and not worthy of care.Slowly the children adjust and become a family.  But their only car breaks down and the innkeeper informs her that she must move as he rented her room to a business.  Desperate and without hope, Martha prays for help.This is a feel good story.
