Some of the short 1 mile ones all the way up to her 5 mile ones.  I like them all.  I feel this one can give you as good a workout as some of her longer ones.  The workout for the arms with the bands is excellent. As we all know as woman we need it.  The reason for the 4 stars is even though she stresses you're not learning dance moves, some of these are. And she goes pretty fast from one to the other.  Now I am a Leslies Sansone person but someone who is starting out would have a problem with this.  I am finding I do this one most often though as it is a terrific workout.  When you're finished you feel like you have done something.

1551063,A19CZ0LP3AE6R6,B008DL4KFE,degsf,"[14, 19]","Leslie's newest DVD is a nice strong 3 mile walk.  The workout incorporates some new moves and Leslie incorporates the resistance band (included with the DVD) during miles 2 and 3 to provide strength training.  There are enough new moves to make the miles go by quickly and Leslie incorporates more arm movements with the walking to keep your heart rate up.  The resistance band work is also done while still walking so that you don't cool down too much while doing the strength training.  I liked the pace of this workout --Miles 1 and 3 are 14 minutes each, while Mile 2 comes in at 12 minutes.  A short cool down and stretch finishes off the workout.  Leslie does miles 1 and 2 with a group and is alone for the last mile.  The music isn't too exciting but the set is nice and light.

I feel like she is forgetting her core fan base and pushing them aside while trying to cater to the younger, already fit crowd.  I liked seeing a variety of ages, body types, and fitness levels, not a group of young, fit, overenthusiastic girls with a token man or overweight person.  The new workouts are just too ""bouncy"" for me (and I love the boosted jogging in earlier DVDs) but can't do the bouncing without severe pain. More importantly, the music is sooo low that you can't hear it but Leslie is soooo loud that you can't turn it up.I don't recommend this one.",2,So disappointed with 3 Mega Miles,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,637,"['First', 'have', 'been', 'disappointed', 'most', 'Leslie', 'newer', 'workouts', 'feel', 'forgetting', 'core', 'fan', 'base', 'pushing', 'aside', 'trying', 'cater', 'younger', 'already', 'fit', 'crowd', 'liked', 'seeing', 'variety', 'ages', 'body', 'types', 'fitness', 'levels', 'not', 'group', 'young', 'fit', 'overenthusiastic', 'girls', 'token', 'man', 'overweight', 'person', 'new', 'workouts', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'bouncy', 'love', 'boosted', 'jogging', 'earlier', 'DVDs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'bouncing', 'severe', 'pain', 'More', 'importantly', 'music', 'sooo', 'low', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'Leslie', 'soooo', 'loud', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'up.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'one']",N/A

Beware, this can NOT be a recently recorded DVD.  Perhaps the &#34;cover&#34; is new.  This DVD appears Years old and wasn't even H D.  The Music is nothing to be happy about, rather drab, and too soft.  Leslie's voice is much, much, louder than the music.  You can do the 3 miles as a long walk, or choose each mile.  I like that.  As always, and something that bothers me, is Leslie continually Chit-Chats the whole tape and this one does not have a &#34;music only&#34; option (most don't).  All that aside I liked the walk.  I believe it does have More Muscle movement in it, even during a walk when you don't use the band.  Wish it was bright, and new - but it isn't.

1551075,A2BF2OUBWDGSZK,B008DL4KFE,TamarinaDC,"[29, 31]","I am a longtime Leslie fan, and have about 15 or so videos. One of my preferences is for a single start-to-finish walk rather than a bunch of separate one-mile walks strung together.  Now, I understand that some people might like to be able to only do a certain mile, but I don't like the ""stop-and-start"" of the individual miles. And I certainly wish that the makers of the videos, including this one, would just label them as ""three separate miles"" or, in the case of a continuous video, ""one complete 3 mile walk.""That said, this video is ok.  I used a band I got from one of Leslie's other videos, so I didn't know that the included band is thicker than those included with her previous videos.  The music is really nothing to write home about, and the cueing could use some work- I find it hard to believe, that after all these years, there's not someone offscreen signaling ""1 minute left"" so that Leslie and those at home wouln't be doing 4 sets of ""mambo combos"" to complete silence (as happens here). But, as is the case with all her videos, if you put the work into it, you'll get a good workout.By the way, what happened to all the old walking buddies Mary Kay, Linda, Joanne, and Carol?  These walkers are all MUCH younger than that group, and most look as if they could easily run a half-marathon.  The one exception in this video is a visiting Catholic priest who is now a walk leader back in my home state of RI- he's the only one who looks as if he needs to lose weight.Regardless of all my complaints, I'll probably buy the next 20 videos Leslie puts out- they work, and I can do them in my small living room without getting down on the floor. I just hope in the future they label them so I'll know what I'm getting before the package arrives in the mail.",3,"3 separate miles, not a 3 mile start-to-finish walk",1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,1772,"['am', 'longtime', 'Leslie', 'fan', 'have', '15', 'so', 'videos', 'One', 'preferences', 'single', 'start-to-finish', 'walk', 'rather', 'bunch', 'separate', 'one-mile', 'walks', 'strung', 'together', 'Now', 'understand', 'people', 'might', 'like', 'be', 'able', 'only', 'do', 'certain', 'mile', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'stop-and-start', 'individual', 'miles', 'certainly', 'wish', 'makers', 'videos', 'including', 'one', 'would', 'just', 'label', 'three', 'separate', 'miles', 'case', 'continuous', 'video', 'one', 'complete', '3', 'mile', 'walk', 'said', 'video', 'ok', 'used', 'band', 'got', 'one', 'Leslie', 'other', 'videos', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'included', 'band', 'thicker', 'included', 'previous', 'videos', 'music', 'really', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'cueing', 'could', 'use', 'work-', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'years', 'not', 'someone', 'offscreen', 'signaling', '1', 'minute', 'left', 'Leslie', 'home', 'woul', ""n't"", 'be', 'doing', '4', 'sets', 'mambo', 'combos', 'complete', 'silence', 'happens', 'here', 'case', 'videos', 'put', 'work', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'workout.By', 'way', 'what', 'happened', 'old', 'walking', 'buddies', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Linda', 'Joanne', 'Carol', 'walkers', 'are', 'all', 'MUCH', 'younger', 'group', 'most', 'look', 'could', 'easily', 'run', 'half-marathon', 'one', 'exception', 'video', 'visiting', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'who', 'now', 'walk', 'leader', 'back', 'home', 'state', 'RI-', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'lose', 'weight.Regardless', 'complaints', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'buy', 'next', '20', 'videos', 'Leslie', 'out-', 'work', 'can', 'do', 'small', 'living', 'room', 'getting', 'down', 'floor', 'just', 'hope', 'future', 'label', 'so', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'getting', 'package', 'mail']",N/A
