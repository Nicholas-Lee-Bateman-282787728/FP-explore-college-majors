1298104,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,B002XOL65E,Brian,"[9, 12]","Since Mr. Cooksey has provided a rundown of BFI's Blu-ray contents, I'll focus on the package's main feature: Essentially a plotless, 90-minute acid-rock music montage/psychedelic cautionary tale, 'Permissive' is as much a test of one's nerves as it is an exploitative ode to London's vacuous hippie-era groupie culture. That isn't to say there isn't something for certain tastes-- a snapshot of Britain's seedier side circa 1970; abundant nudity and passionless softcore sex; omnipresent soundtrack by and gig footage of, among other noisemakers, a really hairy bar band called Forever More, which could as easily have been named Jerry Garcia Fronting Led Zeppelin and They Only Know Four Songs (later to re-form as The Average White Band!)-- but for the sentient moviegoer, this is independent filmmaking at its most dreary and self-indulgent. Poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly written, poorly conceived, 'Permissive' earns 1/2 star for a couple down-and-dirty guitar riffs by my new favorite gaggle of unwashed electric minstrels. Print looks decent in hi-def, considering its grainy 35mm source, and sound quality is very good.",1,Ghastly U.K. indie,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,1131,"['Mr.', 'Cooksey', 'provided', 'rundown', 'BFI', 'Blu-ray', 'contents', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'package', 'main', 'feature', 'Essentially', 'plotless', '90-minute', 'acid-rock', 'music', 'montage/psychedelic', 'cautionary', 'tale', ""'Permissive"", 'as', 'much', 'test', 'one', 'nerves', 'exploitative', 'ode', 'London', 'vacuous', 'hippie-era', 'groupie', 'culture', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'something', 'certain', 'tastes', 'snapshot', 'Britain', 'seedier', 'side', 'circa', '1970', 'abundant', 'nudity', 'passionless', 'softcore', 'sex', 'omnipresent', 'soundtrack', 'gig', 'footage', 'other', 'noisemakers', 'really', 'hairy', 'bar', 'band', 'called', 'Forever', 'More', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'named', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'Fronting', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Only', 'Know', 'Four', 'Songs', 'later', 're-form', 'Average', 'White', 'Band', 'sentient', 'moviegoer', 'independent', 'filmmaking', 'most', 'dreary', 'self-indulgent', 'Poorly', 'shot', 'poorly', 'acted', 'poorly', 'written', 'poorly', 'conceived', ""'Permissive"", 'earns', '1/2', 'star', 'couple', 'down-and-dirty', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'new', 'favorite', 'gaggle', 'unwashed', 'electric', 'minstrels', 'Print', 'decent', 'hi-def', 'considering', 'grainy', '35mm', 'source', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'good']",N/A

And while there's plenty of skin on display, it generally isn't meant to titillate. Permissive has the feel of a documentary in its detached, bleak portrait of a group of people moving like zombies through their empty lives, all set against a London in sharp decline. To that end, there isn't much of a plot and the performances are uniformly low-key. The music scene shown here isn't a glamorous, non-stop party, but a succession of boring road trips, perfunctory hook-ups in cheap hotels, and whatever pointless drama the dysfunctional gang manufactures.But is it art? Permissive is still a cheap indie movie. Boom mics dip into several shots, and some of the non-actors give very non-actory performances. But the sum is a lot more than the parts. At its most basic, it's a twisted rags-to-riches story about naive Suzy's integration into the scene. But what the movie shows-- without being either preachy or melodramatic-- is that the scene isn't much more than a magnet for the lost, the emotionally stunted, the mentally ill, and (in the form of the group's aging manager) those who are more than happy to exploit them. Add to that an absolute ton of footage of 1970 London, and it all adds up to an unusually thoughtful little film that benefits all the more for its matter-of-fact approach to the material. The definition of a hidden gem, as long as you know what you're getting into.",4,A bleak look at Swinging London's morning after,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1517,"['can', 'understand', 'disappointed', 'reviews', 'given', 'many', 'viewers', 'are', 'probably', 'going', 'expecting', 'groovy', 'skinflick', 'plenty', 'skin', 'display', 'generally', ""n't"", 'meant', 'titillate', 'Permissive', 'feel', 'documentary', 'detached', 'bleak', 'portrait', 'group', 'people', 'moving', 'zombies', 'empty', 'lives', 'set', 'London', 'sharp', 'decline', 'end', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'low-key', 'music', 'scene', 'shown', 'here', ""n't"", 'glamorous', 'non-stop', 'party', 'succession', 'boring', 'road', 'trips', 'perfunctory', 'hook-ups', 'cheap', 'hotels', 'pointless', 'drama', 'dysfunctional', 'gang', 'manufactures.But', 'art', 'Permissive', 'still', 'cheap', 'indie', 'movie', 'Boom', 'mics', 'dip', 'several', 'shots', 'non-actors', 'give', 'very', 'non-actory', 'performances', 'sum', 'lot', 'more', 'parts', 'most', 'basic', 'twisted', 'rags-to-riches', 'story', 'naive', 'Suzy', 'integration', 'scene', 'what', 'movie', 'being', 'preachy', 'melodramatic', 'scene', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'magnet', 'lost', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'mentally', 'ill', 'form', 'group', 'aging', 'manager', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'happy', 'exploit', 'Add', 'absolute', 'ton', 'footage', '1970', 'London', 'up', 'unusually', 'thoughtful', 'little', 'film', 'benefits', 'more', 'matter-of-fact', 'approach', 'material', 'definition', 'hidden', 'gem', 'as', 'long', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting']",N/A

The actors and actresses used were o.k. but using some original period music from known artistes would have held me more maybe.
