Hill ""CFH""","[11, 11]","""Pompeii: Back from the Dead"" is a fascinating look at a unique find of human skeletons uncovered in a Pompeii cellar, likely some of last to perish in the Mount Vesuvius eruption in the summer of 79AD. Unlike most remains that were buried in ash and subjected to extreme heat, these were somewhat protected by being enclosed in the cellar. This documentary explains the events that lead up to Pompeii's final days, how the people likely reacted, and what anthropology archeologists can determine from the well preserved remains found at the site. There is also a good deal of speculation and discussion on the ""intimate"" habits of the residence of Pompeii as remembered by history and depicted in the surviving frescoes.This will be worthwhile watching to anyone interested in Roman history!Recommended!CFH",4,A Snapshot In Time - Recommended,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,807,"['Pompeii', 'Back', 'Dead', 'fascinating', 'look', 'unique', 'find', 'human', 'skeletons', 'uncovered', 'Pompeii', 'cellar', 'likely', 'last', 'perish', 'Mount', 'Vesuvius', 'eruption', 'summer', '79AD', 'most', 'remains', 'were', 'buried', 'ash', 'subjected', 'extreme', 'heat', 'were', 'somewhat', 'protected', 'being', 'enclosed', 'cellar', 'documentary', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'Pompeii', 'final', 'days', 'how', 'people', 'likely', 'reacted', 'what', 'anthropology', 'archeologists', 'can', 'determine', 'well', 'preserved', 'found', 'site', 'also', 'good', 'deal', 'speculation', 'discussion', 'intimate', 'habits', 'residence', 'Pompeii', 'remembered', 'history', 'depicted', 'surviving', 'frescoes.This', 'will', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'watching', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Roman', 'history', 'Recommended', 'CFH']",Pompeii: Back From the Dead

1456777,AU2ZQYTLT611C,B005ELVCPW,Menkaure,"[0, 0]","The Discovery Channel is not in the business of education, but entertainment, which is why it repeatedly puts out programs like this that are not only short on facts, but often distort and misrepresent facts. Sometimes, they even stoop to making things up and presenting it to their unsuspecting audience as if it were, indeed, an established fact. Pompeii: Back from the Dead is a perfect case in point. Here are a few of the departures from reality featured in this &#34;documentary.&#34;1) The show's theme is the town of Pompeii; however the focus of the show is a group of skeletons found several miles away in a different town; Oplontis. There is no definite link between these skeletons and Pompeii, except that they died in the same volcanic eruption, but the show consistently refers to the bodies as being Pompeiian.2) The show proclaims that one skeleton in the find is an &#34;African&#34; male. This is based on what??? Since it has been scientifically established that race cannot be determined from bones, how did they reach this startling conclusion?? Was there DNA found?No---a little research reveals that one Italian anthropologist pronounced the skeleton to be African based on the shape of the skull---a practice long since debunked, and a conclusion discredited by the archaeological community: in short, everybody in the field has rejected this anthropologist's sensationalistic claims. The show never discusses any of this--it takes the false identification and runs with it.3) The earthquake--and resulting claims of the show; The show presents the possibility that a major earthquake rattled the region of Pompeii a week before the eruption. More than likely true, given the typical geological activity leading up to a large volcanic event. However, the show postulates that this led to an evacuation of the local population a full week before the eruption. There's no such evidence. In fact, when a major earthquake rattled the region 17 years previous, in 62 AD, no such evacuation took place. People don't generally abandon their property and livelihoods following an earthquake. They pick up the pieces and get back to work. This whole line of reasoning is just put forth to support the show's premise---that the skeletons found at Oplontis were evacuees from Pompeii. Again zero evidence.4) A gladiatorial show taking place at the time of the eruption; the show specifically claims that an &#34;ancient Roman source&#34; records said event. This is a blatant falsehood. The &#34;source&#34; is the Victorian author of the melodramatic novel &#34;The Last Days of Pompeii,&#34; in the 1800s. There is no such Roman account as the documentary claims.There are plenty more misrepresentations, exaggerations, etc., but I've listed some of the more egregious ones that irked me.  I'm afraid you're not going to learn much from this show other than a lot of conjecture.5) Herculeaneum: The show states that the nearby town of Herculeaneum was destroyed, like Pompeii, by the same pyroclastic flow. If you've done any study of this period and event, than you already know that this is not the case. Herculeaneum was destroyed by a volcanic mudslide of super-heated mud, which is somewhat different than the pyroclasim that obliterated Pompeii. This in itself may not seem that important, but it is representative of the sheer sloppiness and disregard for facts of this documentary. Obvious it was not intended for a knowledgeable audience, but I just can't stomach the idea that misinforming an uneducated audience is the way to go with a show that, at least, claims it is informative. In short, the only thing you will really learn from this show is a host of speculations and falsehoods.",1,Waste of Brain Cells,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,3713,"['Discovery', 'Channel', 'not', 'business', 'education', 'entertainment', 'why', 'repeatedly', 'out', 'programs', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'short', 'facts', 'often', 'distort', 'misrepresent', 'facts', 'Sometimes', 'even', 'stoop', 'making', 'things', 'up', 'presenting', 'unsuspecting', 'audience', 'were', 'indeed', 'established', 'fact', 'Pompeii', 'Back', 'Dead', 'perfect', 'case', 'point', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'departures', 'reality', 'featured', '34', 'documentary.', '34', '1', 'show', 'theme', 'town', 'Pompeii', 'however', 'focus', 'show', 'group', 'skeletons', 'found', 'several', 'miles', 'away', 'different', 'town', 'Oplontis', 'definite', 'link', 'skeletons', 'Pompeii', 'died', 'same', 'volcanic', 'eruption', 'show', 'consistently', 'bodies', 'being', 'Pompeiian.2', 'show', 'one', 'skeleton', 'find', '34', 'African', '34', 'male', 'based', 'what', 'been', 'scientifically', 'established', 'race', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'determined', 'bones', 'how', 'did', 'reach', 'startling', 'conclusion', 'Was', 'DNA', 'found', '-a', 'little', 'research', 'reveals', 'one', 'Italian', 'anthropologist', 'pronounced', 'skeleton', 'be', 'African', 'based', 'shape', 'skull', '-a', 'practice', 'long', 'debunked', 'conclusion', 'discredited', 'archaeological', 'community', 'short', 'everybody', 'field', 'rejected', 'anthropologist', 'sensationalistic', 'claims', 'show', 'never', 'false', 'identification', 'it.3', 'earthquake', 'resulting', 'claims', 'show', 'show', 'possibility', 'major', 'earthquake', 'rattled', 'region', 'Pompeii', 'week', 'eruption', 'More', 'likely', 'true', 'given', 'typical', 'geological', 'activity', 'leading', 'up', 'large', 'volcanic', 'event', 'However', 'show', 'led', 'evacuation', 'local', 'population', 'full', 'week', 'eruption', 'such', 'evidence', 'fact', 'when', 'major', 'earthquake', 'rattled', 'region', '17', 'years', 'previous', '62', 'AD', 'such', 'evacuation', 'took', 'place', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'abandon', 'property', 'livelihoods', 'following', 'earthquake', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'whole', 'line', 'reasoning', 'just', 'put', 'forth', 'support', 'show', 'premise', 'skeletons', 'found', 'Oplontis', 'were', 'evacuees', 'Pompeii', 'Again', 'zero', 'evidence.4', 'gladiatorial', 'show', 'taking', 'place', 'time', 'eruption', 'show', 'specifically', '34', 'ancient', 'Roman', 'source', '34', 'records', 'said', 'event', 'blatant', 'falsehood', '34', 'source', '34', 'Victorian', 'author', 'melodramatic', 'novel', '34', 'Last', 'Days', 'Pompeii', '34', '1800s', 'such', 'Roman', 'account', 'documentary', 'are', 'plenty', 'more', 'misrepresentations', 'exaggerations', 'etc.', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'more', 'egregious', 'ones', 'irked', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'learn', 'much', 'show', 'other', 'lot', 'conjecture.5', 'Herculeaneum', 'show', 'nearby', 'town', 'Herculeaneum', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Pompeii', 'same', 'pyroclastic', 'flow', ""'ve"", 'done', 'study', 'period', 'event', 'already', 'know', 'not', 'case', 'Herculeaneum', 'was', 'destroyed', 'volcanic', 'mudslide', 'super-heated', 'mud', 'somewhat', 'different', 'pyroclasim', 'obliterated', 'Pompeii', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'important', 'representative', 'sheer', 'sloppiness', 'disregard', 'facts', 'documentary', 'Obvious', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'knowledgeable', 'audience', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'idea', 'misinforming', 'uneducated', 'audience', 'way', 'go', 'show', 'least', 'claims', 'informative', 'short', 'only', 'thing', 'will', 'really', 'learn', 'show', 'host', 'speculations', 'falsehoods']",Pompeii: Back From the Dead
