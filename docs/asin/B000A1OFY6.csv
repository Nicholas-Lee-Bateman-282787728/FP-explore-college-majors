918592,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B000A1OFY6,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[24, 25]","The good: Verdi's opera about revenge turning back on the one who seeks it, in the form of the worst possible fate, is one of my favorites. The intense drama includes murder and self-sacrificing love, as the hunchback jester Rigoletto, in trying to protect his daughter from the licentious Duke of Mantua, loses everything. The score is marvelous, and it is beautifully sung, especially by Inva Mula (who will be remembered as the singing voice of the Diva Plavalaguna in the film ""The Fifth Element"") as Rigoletto's daughter Gilda. She does a magnificent job in this part, and also excellent are Roberto Servile as Rigoletto, Marcelo Alvarez as the Duke, Andrea Silvestrelli as Sparafucile, and Svetlana Serdar as Maddalena.The bad: The audio balance between the singers and orchestra is appalling. Performed live outdoors in Siena, the setting is lovely, but the sound at times is as if the singers are in your living room, and the musicians are in the bathroom, with the door closed. There is a moment when you see Keri Lynn Wilson conducting an orchestral portion of the opera...and hardly a sound can be heard.The ugly: The costumes by fashion designer Vivienne Westwood are often just that, ugly, and usually ill fitting. The lighting is dreadful, with the singers often in a dim blue spotlight, with the rest of the stage dark. This makes an interesting rental for avid opera fans, and those who would like to hear the wonderful singers, but as an example of a good Rigoletto on DVD, look elsewhere. I have a preference for opera filmed in a live performance rather than the ""movie"" type of presentation, but this one was a disappointment, and I also missed the curtain calls, which are not included on this DVD. Total playing time is 130 minutes.",4,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly",1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,1754,"['good', 'Verdi', 'opera', 'revenge', 'turning', 'back', 'one', 'who', 'form', 'worst', 'possible', 'fate', 'one', 'favorites', 'intense', 'drama', 'murder', 'self-sacrificing', 'love', 'hunchback', 'jester', 'Rigoletto', 'trying', 'protect', 'daughter', 'licentious', 'Duke', 'Mantua', 'everything', 'score', 'marvelous', 'beautifully', 'sung', 'especially', 'Inva', 'Mula', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'singing', 'voice', 'Diva', 'Plavalaguna', 'film', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Rigoletto', 'daughter', 'Gilda', 'magnificent', 'job', 'part', 'also', 'excellent', 'are', 'Roberto', 'Servile', 'Rigoletto', 'Marcelo', 'Alvarez', 'Duke', 'Andrea', 'Silvestrelli', 'Sparafucile', 'Svetlana', 'Serdar', 'Maddalena.The', 'bad', 'audio', 'balance', 'singers', 'orchestra', 'appalling', 'Performed', 'live', 'outdoors', 'Siena', 'setting', 'lovely', 'sound', 'times', 'singers', 'are', 'living', 'room', 'musicians', 'are', 'bathroom', 'door', 'closed', 'moment', 'when', 'see', 'Keri', 'Lynn', 'Wilson', 'conducting', 'orchestral', 'portion', 'opera', 'hardly', 'sound', 'can', 'be', 'heard.The', 'ugly', 'costumes', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Vivienne', 'Westwood', 'are', 'often', 'just', 'ugly', 'usually', 'ill', 'fitting', 'lighting', 'dreadful', 'singers', 'often', 'dim', 'blue', 'spotlight', 'rest', 'stage', 'dark', 'interesting', 'rental', 'avid', 'opera', 'fans', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'wonderful', 'singers', 'example', 'good', 'Rigoletto', 'DVD', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'have', 'preference', 'opera', 'filmed', 'live', 'performance', 'rather', 'movie', 'type', 'presentation', 'one', 'was', 'disappointment', 'also', 'missed', 'curtain', 'calls', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'DVD', 'Total', 'playing', 'time', '130', 'minutes']",Rigoletto Story

Specifically,(1) Having many cameras at different angles and locations should be a big plus.  However, the camera director single-handedly ruined this DVD by randomly switching camera views.  The superimposed images are also annoying.  He needs to be replaced.(2) The performers are credible. Inva Mula is superb.  I have not heard or seen her before.  Vocally Marcelo Alvarez is convincing.  Physically he has too much weight to be convincing as a womanizer.  And to think that the beautiful Mula died for him.  No way!  The make-up for Roberto Sevile is sub-standard.  The mic could have been stapled to his clothing.  Finally, it is an unusual pleasure to see a young energetic female as a big-time conductor.  She did a great job.  The prototype conductor is one with 100% white hair, or no hair, or a conbination of both.(3) This is a live performance under the stars.

918594,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000A1OFY6,Craig Matteson,"[10, 12]","When I put this DVD in the player, I really did not know what kind of performance of Verdi's famous opera would be.  Was it actor's doing the story with singer's providing the music?  Was it going to be cut horribly?  I simply did not know.  However, soon I was delighted to see that it was going to be a film of a straight performance of ""Rigoletto"", but done on a stage setup outside in a big plaza with a huge audience.Now, filming opera presents several problems because filmgoers have very different expectations than opera lovers.  First, the singers do act, but not in the way film actors act.  It is a stage performance and met to be seen from a distance, so the gestures are broad.  This also affects the close-ups of the faces that film requires.  The makeup is done to be seen from a distance and is, of course, not realistic when seen in close-up.  Second, since it is the voice that matters, it is fine for a forty year old to play the role of a very young and innocent Gilda.  Third, the timing and pacing of a 150 year old opera is very different than a modern movie.  However, this is a very compelling story with fabulous music and still captivates people.The story is quite involved, but can be summarized broadly.  Rigoletto is a hunchbacked jester for a womanizing Duke.  He aids the Duke's exploits as a procurer and by his withering verbal attacks on the Duke's opponents.  This has earned Rigoletto much enmity.  An old man appears at a party thrown by the Duke and puts a curse on him and Rigoletto for ruining his daughter.  The jester is quite upset about the curse and takes it seriously.Rigoletto has a daughter, Gilda, who recently came to live with him and has been mistaken by those who mean him harm as a mistress.  The Duke met Gilda at church and is intent on seducing her as well, not knowing she is Rigoletto's daughter.  Events occur that leads Gilda to giver herself to the Duke and Rigoletto swears vengeance.  He hires an assassin he has met earlier and bad things happen to everyone involved.Those are the broad strokes without giving away too much of the plot.  In any case, it is the music that matters here, and it is fabulous.  This opera is more about duets than arias, and there are many kinds presented that add to the telling of the story.  The chorus is all male, which is not common in opera.  In fact, the only women are Gilda, the Countess Ceprano (a small part), and the assassin's sister.This is a very nice way to see the opera in the convenience of your own home, although it won't sound as beautifully as it would be in person.  Being a recording of an outdoor concert there are times the balance gets a bit out of whack, but still, it is done quite well.  It is a bit disconcerting to see the little microphones stuck in the their hair in the middle of their foreheads, but it had to be amplified for the outdoor concert.  The singing is superb.Very well done.",5,A beautifully sung film of an outdoor performance of Verdi's opera,1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,2919,"['When', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'performance', 'Verdi', 'famous', 'opera', 'would', 'be', 'Was', 'doing', 'story', 'singer', 'providing', 'music', 'Was', 'going', 'be', 'cut', 'horribly', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'However', 'soon', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'straight', 'performance', 'Rigoletto', 'done', 'stage', 'setup', 'big', 'plaza', 'huge', 'audience.Now', 'filming', 'opera', 'presents', 'several', 'problems', 'filmgoers', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'expectations', 'opera', 'lovers', 'First', 'singers', 'do', 'act', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'actors', 'act', 'stage', 'performance', 'met', 'be', 'seen', 'distance', 'gestures', 'are', 'broad', 'also', 'close-ups', 'film', 'makeup', 'done', 'be', 'seen', 'distance', 'course', 'not', 'realistic', 'when', 'seen', 'close-up', 'Second', 'voice', 'matters', 'fine', 'forty', 'year', 'old', 'play', 'role', 'very', 'young', 'innocent', 'Gilda', 'Third', 'timing', 'pacing', '150', 'year', 'old', 'opera', 'very', 'different', 'modern', 'movie', 'However', 'very', 'compelling', 'story', 'fabulous', 'music', 'still', 'people.The', 'story', 'quite', 'involved', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'broadly', 'Rigoletto', 'hunchbacked', 'jester', 'womanizing', 'Duke', 'Duke', 'exploits', 'procurer', 'withering', 'verbal', 'attacks', 'Duke', 'opponents', 'earned', 'Rigoletto', 'much', 'enmity', 'old', 'man', 'party', 'thrown', 'Duke', 'curse', 'Rigoletto', 'ruining', 'daughter', 'jester', 'quite', 'upset', 'curse', 'daughter', 'Gilda', 'who', 'recently', 'came', 'live', 'been', 'mistaken', 'who', 'mean', 'harm', 'mistress', 'Duke', 'met', 'Gilda', 'church', 'intent', 'seducing', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'knowing', 'Rigoletto', 'daughter', 'Events', 'occur', 'Gilda', 'giver', 'Duke', 'Rigoletto', 'swears', 'vengeance', 'assassin', 'met', 'earlier', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'everyone', 'involved.Those', 'are', 'broad', 'strokes', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'case', 'music', 'matters', 'here', 'fabulous', 'opera', 'more', 'duets', 'arias', 'are', 'many', 'kinds', 'presented', 'add', 'telling', 'story', 'chorus', 'male', 'not', 'common', 'opera', 'fact', 'only', 'women', 'are', 'Gilda', 'Countess', 'Ceprano', 'small', 'part', 'assassin', 'sister.This', 'very', 'nice', 'way', 'see', 'opera', 'convenience', 'own', 'home', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sound', 'as', 'beautifully', 'would', 'be', 'person', 'Being', 'recording', 'outdoor', 'concert', 'are', 'times', 'balance', 'bit', 'whack', 'still', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'bit', 'disconcerting', 'see', 'little', 'microphones', 'stuck', 'hair', 'middle', 'foreheads', 'had', 'be', 'amplified', 'outdoor', 'concert', 'singing', 'superb.Very', 'well', 'done']",Rigoletto Story
918595,AYDW2AFFLN2QH,B000A1OFY6,"Cy Reese ""screenwriter""","[1, 1]","Given the lukewarm reviews by some of my fellow opera lovers, the only reason I had to purchase and view this DVD was it's ridiculously low price - one cent!  Having seen it, I can now encourage others to experience this production, even if they had to pay full price.  First of all, I was captivated by the views of the outdoor setting - the central plaza in Italy's mountain town of Siena.  Italians of all income and class levels love their opera, and they know their Verdi, so it is commendable that the producers treated as many townspeople as possible to an outdoor performance on an improvised stage.  But from my perspective at home, they didn't cut any corners.  It was a full theatre-type stage, and the cast that peopled that stage is first-rate. I particularly enjoyed the soprano voice of Inva Mula - sweet and melodic. I was surprised that she didn't get as many ""bravas"" as she clearly deserved, but then, I had the benefit of listening to her on a good speaker system and the outdoor live audience perhaps could not appreciate her to the fullest, even though they applauded vigorously on several occasions. Marcelo Alvarez, though on the heavy side, is still a believable Duke, and did manage to elicit some ""bravos"".  In the title role, Roberto Servile, by his singing and acting, conveys to us a full range of emotions: love for his daughter, despair at losing her, loathing for his master and the nobles that surround him, wiliness when he decides to contract the services of an assasin.  And what an assasin! As Sparafucile, Andrea Silvestrelli's basso voice is like the low rumble produced by a woofer speaker - the type you feel as well as hear.  Another reviewer criticizes the ""Chinese-like"" makeup for Rigoletto, and in truth, it is somewhat distracting; but again, we must remember that this is an outdoor performance in a huge venue and exaggeration is a way of letting the patrons in the last row half-a-mile away understand his role and character. Finally, the female conductor Keri-Lynn Wilson elicited passionate playing from the orchestra; given the outdoor setting, the music did not resonate like in an indoor chamber, but it still comes through beautifully on a stereo system.  I feel that this production is about as close as I am going to come for now to experience an outdoor musical event in the middle of an Italian town.  If that idea appeals to you and you are a fan of Verdi, treat yourself to this Rigoletto.",4,Surprisingly good Rigoletto,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,2452,"['Given', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'fellow', 'opera', 'lovers', 'only', 'reason', 'had', 'purchase', 'view', 'DVD', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'price', 'one', 'cent', 'Having', 'seen', 'can', 'now', 'encourage', 'others', 'experience', 'production', 'even', 'had', 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'First', 'was', 'captivated', 'views', 'outdoor', 'setting', 'central', 'plaza', 'Italy', 'mountain', 'town', 'Siena', 'Italians', 'income', 'class', 'levels', 'love', 'opera', 'know', 'Verdi', 'commendable', 'producers', 'treated', 'many', 'townspeople', 'possible', 'outdoor', 'performance', 'improvised', 'stage', 'perspective', 'home', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'corners', 'was', 'full', 'theatre-type', 'stage', 'cast', 'peopled', 'stage', 'first-rate', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'soprano', 'voice', 'Inva', 'Mula', 'sweet', 'melodic', 'was', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'many', 'bravas', 'clearly', 'deserved', 'then', 'had', 'benefit', 'listening', 'good', 'speaker', 'system', 'outdoor', 'live', 'audience', 'perhaps', 'could', 'not', 'appreciate', 'fullest', 'even', 'applauded', 'vigorously', 'several', 'occasions', 'Marcelo', 'Alvarez', 'though', 'heavy', 'side', 'still', 'believable', 'Duke', 'did', 'manage', 'elicit', 'bravos', 'title', 'role', 'Roberto', 'Servile', 'singing', 'acting', 'conveys', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'love', 'daughter', 'despair', 'losing', 'loathing', 'master', 'nobles', 'surround', 'wiliness', 'when', 'contract', 'services', 'assasin', 'what', 'assasin', 'Sparafucile', 'Andrea', 'Silvestrelli', 'basso', 'voice', 'low', 'rumble', 'produced', 'woofer', 'speaker', 'type', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'hear', 'reviewer', 'Chinese-like', 'makeup', 'Rigoletto', 'truth', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'again', 'must', 'remember', 'outdoor', 'performance', 'huge', 'venue', 'exaggeration', 'way', 'letting', 'patrons', 'last', 'row', 'half-a-mile', 'away', 'role', 'character', 'Finally', 'female', 'conductor', 'Keri-Lynn', 'Wilson', 'elicited', 'passionate', 'playing', 'orchestra', 'given', 'outdoor', 'setting', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'resonate', 'indoor', 'chamber', 'still', 'beautifully', 'stereo', 'system', 'feel', 'production', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'am', 'going', 'come', 'now', 'experience', 'outdoor', 'musical', 'event', 'middle', 'Italian', 'town', 'idea', 'appeals', 'are', 'fan', 'Verdi', 'treat', 'Rigoletto']",Rigoletto Story

This filmed production's downfall involves just about everything else. First, the editing involved tons of arbitrary jump cuts; frenetic and nonsensical. The quality of the footage was poor--a lot of the time muddy, dark. The costumes were so chockablock and colorful as to be distracting and ugly. The orchestra sounded miserably scrawny and thin. Was this due to the quality of the playing or the quality of the recording? I only know it sounded poor. As someone has noted, Rigoletto looks as if he's gotten his makeup for a Japanese Kabuki play. Why? And that bald head appliance he has on? Oy, terrible. Because this is an outdoor production, singers are wearing mics. I understand. But do you know where they put Rigoletto's mic? In the middle of his forehead, hanging beneath his bald hat, like a giant zit that shouts: LOOK AT ME. This might be OK for a live audience. But in closeups on video it's very distracting.

918597,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000A1OFY6,Grady Harp,"[10, 10]","For all the technical flaws in this DVD release of a live performance of Verdi's time-honored ""Rigoletto' in the piazza of Siena, Italy, the overall production values are very fine and the music is well served.  Opera requires suspension of belief even in the finest opera houses of the world, so larger-than-life are the stories and characters who sing over a full pit orchestra, overcoming technical vocal hurdles imposed on them by composers, making credibility of acting at a premium.  So it is with filmed opera in live performance where stage makeup, photographed relentlessly in close-ups usually at times when the singers are adjusting their deportment in order to make the sounds required to carry their arias and ensembles, makes everyone look like a caricature.  Few cameramen understand how to keep the veil of distance that preserves the magic of what is happening on a stage far away from the viewer.  Constant close-ups and fancy superimposed images of faces over long shots of a stage  do not help the drama of an opera.But given those problematic flaws, this is a very finely sung and performed 'Rigoletto'.  In the title role Roberto Servile has a lovely baritone voice, if not rich enough to muster the anguish of this court jester deformed by a hunchback.  As the Duke of Mantua Marcelo Alvarez  is blessed with a ringing Verdian tenor voice and acts very well: one is saddened by the fact that this once handsome, lithe young singer is beginning to 'weigh in' with the big tenors!  As Gilda, Albanian soprano Inva Mula is lovely to look at, acts convincingly and sings with a easily flowing, seamless, gorgeous soprano sound.  Her ornamentation is excellent and her 'Cara nome' is a lovely as any on recordings.The costumes by Vivienne Westwood are iconoclastic, apparently the idea was to make all of the members of the court resemble the colors and patterns usually found in the traditional wild uniforms of court jesters (Rigoletto's costume is on the other hand strangely bland). Perhaps from the audience seats they work, but the camera is cruel to them.  The stage direction is routine and Keri Lynn Wilson's conducting is in keeping with the pace of the opera: the dynamics and subtleties are impossible to evaluate due to the overmiking of the singers and the generalized miking of the orchestra.But in all this is a fine performance and certainly one I would recommend to those whose musical tastes have yet to include opera.

918598,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000A1OFY6,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","Verdi is magical and is able to make something rather banal very dense. This Rigoletto is the very case of such a metamorphosis. A father, a hunchback, has a daughter. We will never know who the mother was. The daughter has been raised and is looked after by some nuns. But churchgoing on Sunday morning is a very dangerous activity in Italy. That's where and when a young innocent girl can see the nice handsome boy she is going to start dreaming of. Rigoletto the father is a clown in town and he is facilitating the Duke's conquering of all young females that can move around. As such he is a jester and he attracts the hatred of all fathers, and at the beginning of one in particular who curses him. Verdi hence reverses the Don Giovanni tale. It is the servant who is going to be punished for the philandering of the master. Verdi also changes the tale by making fate the only and sole agent of the fulfillment of this curse. The Duke is going to notice Rigoletto's daughter at church and especially notice that she has noticed him. Then he will use his courtiers to make her elope, then to abuse her and then to drop her. Rigoletto will hire a hit man of the time to get even with the Duke, but I guess hit men were no longer what they had used to be when called Assassins. He kills the daughter instead of the Duke. The father has paid for the killing of his own daughter. The end is absolutely poignant: the farewell ""note"" of that poor girl to her father before she dies in his arms. Verdi has completely put a traditional situation completely on its head. First the servant pays for the philanderer (Don Giovanni). Then the daughter dies in the arms of her father, which is quite a twist from Romeo and Juliet or from Goethe's Werther. The soiled daughter is punished by her being killed in the place of the Duke by the hit man of her own father (think of Margaret in Faust, executed by the German Puritans for fornication in Goethe, executed by the Republic for overdosing her mother with sleeping potion in Berlioz, and executed by the Republic for killing her own child in Gounod). The Duke goes on unscathed (Don Giovanni of course who is punished, but also Faust who escapes but with the magic of his own damnation). But the Italian opera, Verdi's in particular, is absolutely magical to sing and evoke and recreate love. Love is their real stuff, love and its frustration of course. The love song of Rigoletto to his daughter is the most beautiful love song I know, because it is absolutely not sexual, not founded on desire, impulses, drives etc. It is a pure passion. The pure passion of a father for his daughter with a recollection of her dead mother in her: it is a double love song deeply dressed up in a mourning song. To reach such a love of pure passion has rarely been equaled. Romeo and Juliet are sexual lovers. As lovers their love is pure. But here we are beyond that purity in the virginal power of a father's love and a daughter's love. That enables us to see how vain and superficial the love of the Duke for his young and innocent conquests is. The Duke is the rotten enemy but this here moral society punishes the servant by having his daughter killed by a hit man paid by this servant her father. This production of the opera benefits from the fact it was filmed in Siena, on the main square, in a memorable site. The actors had to be wired but it does not show too much with modern technology.

Holland,"[11, 11]","There's little I care to add to the very astute comments by my fellow reviewers, as I fully concur with almost everything that has thus far been noted.I will say that I was not at odds with the production. True, this is not, by any means, a very ""traditional"" adaptation of the opera, but that's what I like about it.I enjoyed the still effects, the slow motion overlays and the sometimes bizzare lighting effects.What I didn't care for was the make-up work.Some of the characters, Rigoletto in particular, looked like participants in a CHINESE opera, not a Verdi opera.You can look at the DVD cover art to see my point.Also not a fan of the costumes....eccentric fashion designs only work with a minimalist or abstract setting such as those employed in many modern operas. They don't work in a traditional setting.Roberto Serville didn't impress me with his vocal chops. I thought his to be a finely acted perfromance, but vocally his voice lacks the power and sheer volume needed to really make this part work to its best effect.Inva Mula did a very nice job both vocally and acting wise.Marcello Alvarez turned also turned in a characteristically fine performance on all levels. The only problem with him these days is that he's getting..well...fat! Apparently there is some unwritten rule in opera lore that mandates that, as a tenors voice grows larger and heavier, so must the tenor himself.The one perfromer who really impressed me was Andrea Silvestrelli. Hearing a good Basso in grand opera is almost as rare as hearing a good tenore. This is a big man, with a huge bass voice, who can also act quite convincingly.Only one word of caution. The title of the DVD can be misleading because from looking at the cover and reading the title, some may think this to be a movie version of the opera.This is a full scale operatic perfromance. Why the producers decided to call it the ""Rigoletto Story"" is not clear.If you want to see a new, and slightly off color version of this classic opera then you'll enjoy this.

The production itself seemed to be idomatic Verdi; the costumes were fine and we get the pluses but very few minuses of an outdoor presentation.  Yeah, the editing is a bit herky-jerky at times butI did not find it obstrusive at all and, on occasion, it was quite effective (like when Gilda is stabbed by Sparafucile.) There are a few times where I wouldn't have shown the conductor during key dramatic moments.Inva Mula, who I'd never heard of, is an excellent Gilda, pulling off an almost flawless""Caro Nome.""  Marcelo Alvarez is a near-ideal Duke, with a ringing tenor voice that is a nice alternative to the usual Pavarotti or Domingo (both great, of course.) The few extra pounds actually suit thisamoral character.  Roberto Servile is the problem.  This may have been an off-night for him, as I've heard much better singing from him on YouTube.  There's just too much vibrato for Servile to make a positive impression; it is one of those vocal performances where too often the voice surrounds a note rather than nailing it.  Andrea Silvestrelli is a Sparafucile you wouldn't want to mess with and Svetlana Serdar is almostas good as his sister (and certainly looks the part.)  The Monteroneand Ceprano both sport excellent basso voices.  Keri Lynn Wilson conducts well, although the opening courtier scene has a tad too much adrenaline.As a good, lower priced ""Rigoletto,"" coming from someone who has listened to opera for some forty years, I'd recommend this for the budget-minded.",3,Good Rigoletto in the bargain bin,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,1618,"['was', 'lucky', 'stumble', 'Big', 'Lots', 'places', 'few', 'bucks', 'have', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'Rigoletto', 'DVD', 'production', 'seemed', 'be', 'idomatic', 'Verdi', 'costumes', 'were', 'fine', 'get', 'pluses', 'very', 'few', 'minuses', 'outdoor', 'presentation', 'Yeah', 'editing', 'bit', 'herky-jerky', 'times', 'butI', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'obstrusive', 'occasion', 'was', 'quite', 'effective', 'when', 'Gilda', 'stabbed', 'Sparafucile', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'shown', 'conductor', 'key', 'dramatic', 'moments.Inva', 'Mula', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'excellent', 'Gilda', 'pulling', 'off', 'almost', 'flawless', 'Caro', 'Nome', 'Marcelo', 'Alvarez', 'near-ideal', 'Duke', 'ringing', 'tenor', 'voice', 'nice', 'alternative', 'usual', 'Pavarotti', 'Domingo', 'great', 'course', 'few', 'extra', 'pounds', 'actually', 'suit', 'thisamoral', 'character', 'Roberto', 'Servile', 'problem', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'off-night', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'much', 'better', 'singing', 'YouTube', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'vibrato', 'Servile', 'make', 'positive', 'impression', 'one', 'vocal', 'performances', 'where', 'too', 'often', 'voice', 'note', 'rather', 'nailing', 'Andrea', 'Silvestrelli', 'Sparafucile', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'mess', 'Svetlana', 'Serdar', 'almostas', 'good', 'sister', 'certainly', 'part', 'Monteroneand', 'Ceprano', 'sport', 'excellent', 'basso', 'voices', 'Keri', 'Lynn', 'Wilson', 'well', 'opening', 'courtier', 'scene', 'tad', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'lower', 'priced', 'Rigoletto', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'listened', 'opera', 'forty', 'years', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'budget-minded']",Rigoletto Story
