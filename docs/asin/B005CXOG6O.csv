I am therefore happy to have this DVD. It brought back a good deal of that joyful feeling I experienced throughout the playoffs. But I cannot help but say that it could have been so much better. It is just an ""okay"" effort. Game 6 of the World Series is perhaps the best example. The lead up to the game tying hits in the 9th and 10th innings was insufficient. The drama was not built, and boy was there drama. That is true of much else as well: wasted opportunities. But the story is such a good one, so compelling and emotional, that even this modest effort is worth the cost.Also as others have said - it is difficult to explain the choice of game 5 of the Phillies series over Game 6 of the World Series if you can only include one full game.",3,Glad I have it....but,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,851,"['am', 'lifelong', 'Cardinals', 'fan', 'season', 'offered', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'all-time', 'rooting', 'experience', 'am', 'therefore', 'happy', 'have', 'DVD', 'brought', 'back', 'good', 'deal', 'joyful', 'feeling', 'experienced', 'playoffs', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'just', 'okay', 'effort', 'Game', '6', 'World', 'Series', 'perhaps', 'best', 'example', 'lead', 'up', 'game', 'tying', 'hits', '9th', '10th', 'innings', 'was', 'insufficient', 'drama', 'was', 'not', 'built', 'boy', 'was', 'there', 'drama', 'true', 'much', 'else', 'as', 'well', 'wasted', 'opportunities', 'story', 'such', 'good', 'one', 'compelling', 'emotional', 'even', 'modest', 'effort', 'cost.Also', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'difficult', 'explain', 'choice', 'game', '5', 'Phillies', 'series', 'Game', '6', 'World', 'Series', 'can', 'only', 'include', 'one', 'full', 'game']",2011 World Series Champions: St. Louis Cardinals
1454587,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B005CXOG6O,Michael A. Newman,"[1, 1]",I have purchased every WS video since 1996 and am rarely disappointed.  The 2011 World Series ranks up with the most exciting I ever saw and Game 6 was the most exciting game I have ever watched in all the years I have been watching baseball!  The video itself has a new narrator that is not as good as in years past (hence I didn't give it the full five stars) but some of the extras are novel.  There is a second DVD included with the National League clinching game.  The bonus fearures have David Frees' walkoff 6th game homerun repeated 5 times with different announcers including international announcers.  The postgame interview with Lance Berkman and Frees was priceless.  Frees talks about growing up and watching a walk-off homerun in St. Louis' 2004 playoffs not realizing that Berkman played in the game for the Astros.
