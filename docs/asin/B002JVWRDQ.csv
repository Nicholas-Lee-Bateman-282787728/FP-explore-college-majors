Maybe all of 4 and part of 5.  But around 5 or 6 it got good again.  Then around 8 or 9 it sucked again.  10, the last season, sucked too.  That's why I didn't watch it till I decided to complete my collection recently.  I had the first 8 seasons.  Might as well complete my collection.  I'm glad I did, because I got to watch a whole bunch of episodes that were new to me.  They weren't as bad as I thought they'd be, but still not as good as when the show started.  Heck, after 3 seasons, I'm sure you run out of ideas then get more later on.  That's probably what happened.  I didn't watch half of season 10 on TV, nor did I download it on a sharing network like I did for 8 and 9.  I did however watch the final episode.  Couldn't miss that one!  I rated this season 9 four stars being that I don't recall if I liked it or didn't. LOL  If it's the one with Zod, I didn't like it much.  Those episodes were hella boring.

Since that time, I've been racing 'faster than a speeding bullet' to get caught up.  Season Nine is just packed with all kinds of Superhero goodness.  Many of my favorite episodes are right in the middle of the season, but its a strong outing for Smallville from start to finish.Old school DC fans who grew up on the Superfriends will no doubt enjoy IDOL where Wonder Twins Zan and Jayna show up in Metropolis.  The episode's 21st Century spin, with cell phones and Facebook, pays homage to the characters while updating them nicely.  WARRIOR was also a great installment, giving a nod to many fans who head out to the local convention scene.  My highlight of the season - and I can't believe I am alone - is ABSOLUTE JUSTICE.  Clark, Ollie, and The Manhunter team, up with Hawkman, Stargirl, and some old school heroes to defend Metropolis from a new threat.  This two hour movie was great the first time around and really stands up to multiple viewings.Its hard to believe that, as I write this, these characters are in their tenth and final season.  We've come along way from Smallville High.  The characters have really stretched and grown and there have been many notable additions and guest stars.

Disturbingly, the main characters have also degenerated with the worst being, most unfortunately, Clark/Superman/Kent.  The series appears to have lost its primary focus of Clark becoming the true comic book hero that loyal patrons, the world over, have loved for more than seven decades.

1273282,AI46E73DWKD2B,B002JVWRDQ,BackToGood,"[0, 0]","SMALLVILLE perhaps peaked with SEASON 9! I think it's the only season where there are no weak main characters and also the running storyline/plot (Zod and the Kandorian army) of Season 9 was handled in a spot on manner, with real fluidity, humanity, and power. I badly wanted Season 8 to be the best season since it felt more like a ""Superman"" show, but the show's creative staff made some huge blunders (the Lana arc, killing off an iconic character, and the disappointing DOOMSDAY season finale) that turned what should have been a magnificent, all-time season into a rather what-could-have-been one.The Season 9 premiere SAVIOR starts off about two weeks after the events of the S8 finale DOOMSDAY, with a brooding Clark Kent (stalwart Tom Welling) still mourning the death of ""Jimmy"", the disappearance of Lois (the Legion ring sent her into the future) and blaming himself for what transpired with Davis Bloome. Clark has resolved to cut all ties to humanity and train at the fortress and fight injustice from the shadows. No longer the Red-Blue Blur, now he is just The Blur, draped in dark outfits with the House of El symbol (cap S) on his chest. Chloe (charming Allison Mack) tries to convince Clark to no avail that he is more than just an alien and that his Earth ties are important to who he is. In the exciting opening sequence to SAVIOR, Lois (gorgeous Erica Durance) returns from the future, landing on the Metropolis Monorail, and is followed by a mysterious ninja-draped warrior woman named Alia; they fight on the train and the time rift opening causing the rail to go off the tracks and Clark saves everyone and sees Lois through the window; her return gives him a renewed sense of hope and purpose. As the ep unfolds, we find out that Alia has returned from the future to try to kill Clark (they have an exciting hand-to-hand combat fight in his barn while both powerless due to blue Kryptonite); meanwhile Major Zod (brilliant cast addition Callum Blue) and his Kandorian army (inadvertently brought to Earth by Tess using the Rao symbol in DOOMSDAY) have infiltrated the Luthor mansion and Zod compels Tess (returning regular Cassidy Freeman) to side with him in helping them to re-gain their powers on Earth. This superb premiere sets up a great season!Early Season 9 contains some of the best eps, with Eps 2-METALLO (with a surprising strong guest turn by Brian Austin Green as the title character) and 3-RABID (a zombie-themed ep) surpassing SAVIOR in greatness. RABID in particular has a magnificent Clark/Lois scene in the rain near the ep's end that is beautiful to watch! I know the show is taking their budding romance slowly, but these two incredible looking people ought to be all over each other! Even the immediately weaker eps 4-ECHO and 5-ROULETTE have great Clark/Lois interactions; Welling and Durance have undeniably fantastic chemistry! The next great ep is 6-CROSSFIRE, a more iconic Clark and Lois dating-themed episode with Clark trying to help Lois get a gig as a morning TV show host; the end of the ep has a great series turning point that many fans have been waiting YEARS to happen! Early season 9 continued on a strong path with ep 7-KANDOR, flashbacking to Zod and his army before they cloned themselves prior to the destruction of Krypton; we get to see Zod and Jor-El (played in a heartfelt performance by guest star Julian Sands). Ep 8-IDOL is another iconic Lois-Clark ep with Lois torn between Clark and The Blur and ends with I think one of the top Clark-Lois moments in the entire series. The great, tragic Ep 9-PANDORA finally explains what happened to Lois when she went to the future between DOOMSDAY and SAVIOR. Ep 10-DISCIPLE gives the viewer the first taste of Clark and Lois as an actual couple! The weakest part of S9 for me is the 2-hour ABSOLUTE JUSTICE (which will end up being 2 separate 1-hour eps 11 and 12 on the S9 DVD). I just felt it had little important to do with the rest of S10 (kind of what that Lana arc did to S8!) and it was kind of all over the place.Later Season 9 kicks into high gear focusing on Zod and his plans for world domination and Clark trying to bring out the good in Zod (as his clone father Jor-El compelled him to do in KANDOR) and bond with his Kandorian ""family"". Standout eps include 15-CONSPIRACY, where Clark and Lois separately deal with a mad doctor bent on taking down suspected aliens (Clark works with Zod's lieutenant Faora to save her sister Vala), 17-CHECKMATE, where Chloe (as Watchtower) is kidnapped by Amanda Waller (solidly played by Pam Grier), the head of government organization Checkmate to reveal the identities of the Justice League members, 19-CHARADE, a heartbreaking episode where Lois is truly torn between Clark and The Blur, 21-HOSTAGE, the return of Martha Kent (a welcome brief return by the radiant Annette O'Toole), and the landmark season finale 22-SALVATION, perhaps the best finale of the entire series!The overall tone of Season 9 is darker and more mature than all previous seasons and may not sit well with more traditional SMALLVILLE fans that prefer the early years ""freak-of-the-week"" format and lighter tone. There isn't much lightness to Season 9 as it is definitely more hardcore in it's presentation. The writing and acting of Season 9 is hands down the best the show has ever had and the show benefits from having a smaller main cast than in previous years, so that each character gets just enough screen time for the season. Callum Blue as Major Zod (next to Lex Luthor) is probably the best villain SMALLVILLE has ever had, and because he got the one season (whereas Lex began to wear thin in his later seasons) to showcase his talents, he'll probably pound-for-pound be considered the best villain. The Clark-Lois chemistry (as played superbly by Welling and Durance) is always welcome and is always there even in the weaker eps. I like that they are presented as an all-too-human couple that are both unsure of their intertwined destinies; they almost act afraid of how powerful their feelings are for each other at times; there is a maturity about their relationship that is refreshing to follow. With any season, there will be a few missteps, like the Ollie-Chloe pairing and ABSOLUTE JUSTICE as mentioned earlier, but all in all, Season 9 is probably the best, most consistent season of

Clark gets a new suit, John Corben gets introduced and the Kandor storyline and all its mysteries are laid out for the season. Season 9's strengths lie primarily in Zod's story arc, the development of Clark and Lois' relationship as well as the introduction of several DC characters in the Smallville universe. While other seasons seem to prolong Clark's destiny, season 9 is taking long strides to get there. Season 9 ends in dramatic fashion, like most of the Smallville finales) and sets up the introduction of DC's darkest villain Darkseid.

1273290,AU2K7WFIIBWER,B002JVWRDQ,"Damon A. Ekstrom ""dgekstrom""","[2, 4]","First off, I want to let it be known that this review will reflect season 9 and not the discs that the show is formatted on.  So with that out of way, let's start shall we?The past nine seasons of Smallville have certainly been a wild ride.  Never before has a show managed to stir up so many emotions within myself.  For every moment of pure happiness and sadness, there were just as many emotions that dwelled in the realm of utter distaste(read my previous reviews if your so inclined to know what those reasons might be).I had little hope of this show rejuvenating my interest in the ninth season.  Over the past eight seasons Clark has managed to defeat the likes of Braniac(twice), Lord Zod, Bizzaro, and Doomsday.  Keep in mind that Clark won all these battles while not only living in Smallville, but he still hasn't reached his full potential(in other words, you still can't call the guy Superman).  Speaking of Smallville, I find it rather unusual that every character with the exception of Clark has managed to move on.  It's even stranger when you consider that not only is he working alongside Lois Lane at the Daily Planet, but he's been seeing Lois as well(yes you read that right, Lois and Clark are DATING!).The season eight finale revealed that Lord Zod would once again be entering the realm of Smallville.  After already having a feeling of ""been there done that"" established, and Clark being fully capable of handling all threats in Metropolis from the confines of the farm house, it leaves little hope for any originality in what is essentially now Smallville's twilight years.  I've never been more happy to be proven wrong.The Lord Zod that emerges is actually a clone, and while that would certainly seem like a cheesy gimmick, fortunately he's not alone.  A decent size of the Kandorian army were cloned as well, including Jor-El, Clark's biological father.  I was amused by this, but I still didn't know if this would lead to anything meaningful.  Thankfully this choice allowed Clark to grow as an individual and become more independent.  Because despite being clones, this meant that Clark was no longer the last remaining Kryptonian.  He learned first hand that Kryptonians were indeed a civil race, and that Jor-El wasn't the bad guy he perceived him to be.  But every race has it's share of good and bad alike, and despite giving it his all, Clark learns that sometimes you just can't alter destiny.  Because in a rather interesting twist, we learn early on that Zod was cloned back when he still had a defining rank of major.  This gave the writers a chance to get inside Zod's head and show that despite being a clone, he will ultimately end up making the same choices that will lead him down the same path as the original Zod.Naturally there ends up being a divide amongst the Kandorians as to whom they should be following. Do they follow their commanding officer, or the true last remaining Kryptonian?  Zod attempts his best to sway their loyalty by promising that he will find a way to activate their abilities, because for reasons unknown to them, they arrived on earth without the same powers that Clark possesses.  And Zod will stop at nothing to see this come to fruition.  After all, the only thing powerful men crave is more power.Sprinkled throughout this season were episodes that highlighted special appearances from staple DC characters.  The two hour Justice Society episode was particularly special for those familiar with the DC universe.  The introduction of Metallo however was strangely unusual.  Here you have a character that is infamously known as one of Superman's rivals, yet they portray him as a misunderstood individual with a heart of gold.  As quick as the writers were to write off every ""meteor freak"" as nothing more than a villain, I'm surprised at the path they took with Metallo.What I loved best about this season was that it stayed focused on one goal.  No longer were there episodes detracting from the plot line that had been driving this season.  Never before has Clark been more focused on fulfilling his destiny.  Here's hoping the writers can manage wrap up this alternate take on Superman in a way that is not only logical, but meaningful.",4,A light at the end of the tunnel,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,4219,"['First', 'want', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'review', 'will', 'reflect', 'season', '9', 'not', 'discs', 'show', 'formatted', 'So', 'way', 'let', 'start', 'shall', 'past', 'nine', 'seasons', 'Smallville', 'have', 'certainly', 'been', 'wild', 'ride', 'Never', 'show', 'managed', 'stir', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'moment', 'pure', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'emotions', 'dwelled', 'realm', 'utter', 'distaste', 'read', 'previous', 'reviews', 'so', 'inclined', 'know', 'what', 'reasons', 'might', 'be', '.I', 'had', 'little', 'hope', 'show', 'rejuvenating', 'interest', 'ninth', 'season', 'past', 'eight', 'seasons', 'Clark', 'managed', 'defeat', 'likes', 'Braniac', 'twice', 'Lord', 'Zod', 'Bizzaro', 'Doomsday', 'Keep', 'mind', 'Clark', 'won', 'battles', 'not', 'only', 'living', 'Smallville', 'still', ""n't"", 'reached', 'full', 'potential', 'other', 'words', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'guy', 'Superman', 'Speaking', 'Smallville', 'find', 'rather', 'unusual', 'character', 'exception', 'Clark', 'managed', 'move', 'even', 'stranger', 'when', 'consider', 'not', 'only', 'working', 'alongside', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'been', 'seeing', 'Lois', 'as', 'well', 'yes', 'read', 'right', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'are', 'DATING', '.The', 'season', 'eight', 'finale', 'revealed', 'Lord', 'Zod', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'entering', 'realm', 'Smallville', 'already', 'having', 'feeling', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'established', 'Clark', 'being', 'fully', 'capable', 'handling', 'threats', 'Metropolis', 'confines', 'farm', 'house', 'little', 'hope', 'originality', 'what', 'essentially', 'now', 'Smallville', 'twilight', 'years', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'more', 'happy', 'be', 'proven', 'wrong.The', 'Lord', 'Zod', 'actually', 'clone', 'would', 'certainly', 'seem', 'cheesy', 'gimmick', 'fortunately', 'not', 'alone', 'decent', 'size', 'Kandorian', 'army', 'were', 'cloned', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Jor-El', 'Clark', 'biological', 'father', 'was', 'amused', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'lead', 'anything', 'meaningful', 'Thankfully', 'choice', 'allowed', 'Clark', 'grow', 'individual', 'become', 'more', 'independent', 'being', 'clones', 'meant', 'Clark', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'last', 'remaining', 'Kryptonian', 'learned', 'first', 'hand', 'Kryptonians', 'were', 'indeed', 'civil', 'race', 'Jor-El', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'guy', 'perceived', 'be', 'race', 'share', 'good', 'bad', 'alike', 'giving', 'Clark', 'sometimes', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'alter', 'destiny', 'rather', 'interesting', 'twist', 'learn', 'early', 'Zod', 'was', 'cloned', 'back', 'when', 'still', 'had', 'defining', 'rank', 'major', 'gave', 'writers', 'chance', 'get', 'Zod', 'head', 'show', 'being', 'clone', 'will', 'ultimately', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'same', 'choices', 'will', 'lead', 'down', 'same', 'path', 'original', 'Zod.Naturally', 'up', 'being', 'divide', 'Kandorians', 'whom', 'should', 'be', 'following', 'Do', 'follow', 'commanding', 'officer', 'true', 'last', 'remaining', 'Kryptonian', 'Zod', 'best', 'sway', 'loyalty', 'promising', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'activate', 'abilities', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'arrived', 'earth', 'same', 'powers', 'Clark', 'Zod', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'see', 'come', 'fruition', 'only', 'thing', 'powerful', 'men', 'crave', 'more', 'power.Sprinkled', 'season', 'were', 'episodes', 'highlighted', 'special', 'appearances', 'staple', 'DC', 'characters', 'two', 'hour', 'Justice', 'Society', 'episode', 'was', 'particularly', 'special', 'familiar', 'DC', 'universe', 'introduction', 'Metallo', 'however', 'was', 'strangely', 'unusual', 'Here', 'have', 'character', 'infamously', 'known', 'one', 'Superman', 'rivals', 'yet', 'portray', 'misunderstood', 'individual', 'heart', 'gold', 'As', 'quick', 'writers', 'were', 'write', 'off', 'meteor', 'freak', 'nothing', 'more', 'villain', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'path', 'took', 'Metallo.What', 'loved', 'best', 'season', 'was', 'stayed', 'focused', 'one', 'goal', 'No', 'longer', 'were', 'there', 'episodes', 'detracting', 'plot', 'line', 'had', 'been', 'driving', 'season', 'Never', 'Clark', 'been', 'more', 'focused', 'fulfilling', 'destiny', 'Here', 'hoping', 'writers', 'can', 'manage', 'wrap', 'up', 'alternate', 'take', 'Superman', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'logical', 'meaningful']",N/A

But now, Clark Kent seems more a native of Dullsville as he inhabits the great city of Insipidopolis working (occasionally) a job for which he is completely unqualified and speeding around the city tackling bad guys while dressed like a Goth flasher and still trying to figure out why he's on Earth.Superman is implausible by definition, and Smallville has always stretched the limits of reason, to whit: twenty-five-year-old actors playing high school freshman, Chloe spending four years as school editor and having 24/7 access to the school (not to mention her impossible abilities as a computer hacker), Tess Harper seemingly as super as Superman, etc.  But the series has become insanely implausible.  I can accept the premise of a man with super strength and who can fly through the air (except that by season 9 Clark still can't fly although he did in previous seasons when affected by turquoise or ecru or whatever color d'jour of kryptonite was available).  That is the Superman story, after all.  What I can't accept is the human characters, episode after episode, getting socked in the head by super-villains and thusly smashed into a wall fifteen feet across the room only to rise with nothing more than a few cuts on their faces that likely will heal before the end of the show and certainly by the next one.  Lois has been clobbered so often that by episode 9 she should look like an NHL goalie that never wore a mask and the have mental acuity of an Alzheimer's victim.  Lana was possessed so many times that she should have left the show a raving lunatic.  And exactly how does Chloe earn a living?  I've wearied of watching 120 lb. women routinely beat the daylights out of 200 lb. muscular men themselves trained in the martial arts.  And how does the disembodied Jor-El carry on perpetual interactive conversations with Clark (not to mention that he is as quixotic as the fictional character that generated that adjective)?  It would seem from the number of Krytonians that keep appearing that all the inhabitants of Krypton escaped before the planet exploded.  And enough with the kryptonite that seems to be more common on Earth than granite.  It would seem by now that half of planet Earth knows Clark's secret.  Since Clark has never adopted the traditional wimpy persona, he'll never be able to adopt a dual identity.  I could go on, but you get the point.

He's basically a replacement for the Smallville version Lex Luthor, who like 'Major', we see before he became the archnemesis of Superman. Last time we saw Zod was the season finale for Season 5 and premiere for Season 6, in that he possessed Lex Luthor and was easily defeated by Clark in a 3 minute fight where at the end he was banished to the Phantom Zone.

Darkseid is a demigod, and he was defeated so...nevermind)Clark finally wears a REAL COSTUME (not the red jacket/blue t-shirt deal. And I like the black costume over the red leather jacket costume in Season 10! He looks like Flash Gordon with an S on his chest! ) The Blur's black costume is reminiscent of Superman's black Kryptonian costume from the comics (and perhaps from the Tim Burton version when he was picked to direct 'Superman Lives', the cancelled movie where Superman wore an all black costume) and we finally see him wearing his family crest (the 'S') on his chest. The whole back and forth with Clark and Zod was very similar with Clark's relationship with Lex, as they befriended each other at first (although Clark is never truly trusting of Zod, knowing what his older self turned into)Clark and Lois' romantic relationship develops, we are introduced to Metallo, we see more of Green Arrow and meet his new sidekick Mia (known as Speedy in the comics), we see Jor-EL in the flesh and Krypton in the episode 'Kandor', (which shows the friendship Jor-EL and Zod had, similar to Clark and Lex)and we meet the Justice Society of America (Featuring a super hero cast of Hawkman, Dr.Fate, Stargirl, Star-Spangled Kid, Sandman, and villian Icicle). And finally, behind the scenes we see Checkmate, the secret government organization bent on taking down superhumans, believing they are a major threat to mankind.Overall, a huge improvement on the disappointment of Season 8 (the Doomsday storyline, very poor writing, many holes in the plot, terrible climax! And why get rid of Jimmy?) and in my opinion better than any other season, including Season 10.Just one complaint I have about ALL of Smallville's episodes: The human characters have had to have MULTIPLE CONCUSSIONS as they have been thrown across rooms so many times and have been knocked unconscious! And they have been in Smallville and Metropolis Hospitals MULTIPLE times, with HUNDREDS of injuries! Where are the scars? Human characters like Chloe, Lana, Lois, Lex, Oliver, Tess, Jimmy, Martha, etc.. have ALL had injuries to their body and face, yet they have no scars!?

1273297,A3A6O7SC8LKXDL,B002JVWRDQ,EPA316,"[1, 1]","I have stuck with this show from the beginning, and now I am torn about how I feel. The show looks fantastic as always; all of the scenes and shots look amazing. The acting is not the problem. All of the cast are doing a great job. There are several annoying problems with the storyline that prevent me from really enjoying this.First, Clark should be able to fly by now. I know, I know, there was that ""no flights, no tights"" rule back in 2001. I also know that no one then could have guessed that this show would have made it nine seasons. Kara is a teenager and she can fly. Clark is about 24 by now, so he should be able to fly.Second, there are so many twists and turns in the plot that you would need a notebook and a flowchart to keep track of it all. I miss the early years when all you had to keep track of was how evil Lex was this week, and the freak of the week that would either be dead or in the loony bin by the end of the episode.Also, is Oliver's secret the worst kept secret in all of Metropolis? Even Lois knows that one. It seems he's pretty casual about admitting who he is.Now that I've complained, here's what I liked about this season. I did like the ""Absolute Justice"" two-parter. Even though I had not even heard of any of the comic book heroes in it, I still enjoyed it a lot. I like Lois and Clark's romance progressing, and I also like that Lois figured out Clark's secret. Thankfully they did not drag out the angst as much as with Lana. Major Zod actually was a better addition than I thought he would be. The ""is he evil or not"" uncertainty was interesting.So, for season 10, the last one, I get the feeling that they are going to let it all hang out; pull out all the stops and go for broke. I think it will be the best one yet. My questions are, how long will we have to wait to see Clark flying? How will anyone be fooled by Clark's disguise of a pair of glasses, when he has not worn them for all these years? How long until Lois clues Clark in that she knows his secret? It'll be interesting to find out.",4,"Please, PLEASE let Clark fly!!",1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,2041,"['have', 'stuck', 'show', 'beginning', 'now', 'am', 'torn', 'how', 'feel', 'show', 'fantastic', 'always', 'scenes', 'shots', 'look', 'amazing', 'acting', 'not', 'problem', 'cast', 'are', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'are', 'several', 'annoying', 'problems', 'storyline', 'prevent', 'really', 'enjoying', 'this.First', 'Clark', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'fly', 'now', 'know', 'know', 'was', 'flights', 'tights', 'rule', 'back', '2001', 'also', 'know', 'one', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'guessed', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'nine', 'seasons', 'Kara', 'teenager', 'can', 'fly', 'Clark', '24', 'now', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'fly.Second', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'would', 'need', 'notebook', 'flowchart', 'keep', 'track', 'miss', 'early', 'years', 'when', 'had', 'keep', 'track', 'was', 'how', 'evil', 'Lex', 'was', 'week', 'freak', 'week', 'would', 'either', 'be', 'dead', 'loony', 'bin', 'end', 'episode.Also', 'Oliver', 'secret', 'worst', 'kept', 'secret', 'Metropolis', 'Even', 'Lois', 'one', 'pretty', 'casual', 'admitting', 'who', ""'ve"", 'complained', 'here', 'what', 'liked', 'season', 'did', 'like', 'Absolute', 'Justice', 'two-parter', 'Even', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'heard', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'like', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'romance', 'progressing', 'also', 'like', 'Lois', 'figured', 'out', 'Clark', 'secret', 'Thankfully', 'did', 'not', 'drag', 'out', 'angst', 'as', 'much', 'Lana', 'Major', 'Zod', 'actually', 'was', 'better', 'addition', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'evil', 'not', 'uncertainty', 'was', 'interesting.So', 'season', '10', 'last', 'one', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'going', 'let', 'hang', 'out', 'pull', 'stops', 'go', 'broke', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'yet', 'questions', 'are', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'Clark', 'flying', 'How', 'will', 'anyone', 'be', 'fooled', 'Clark', 'disguise', 'pair', 'glasses', 'when', 'not', 'worn', 'years', 'How', 'long', 'Lois', 'clues', 'Clark', 'secret', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'find', 'out']",N/A
1273298,A6ZKAHCONUHX5,B002JVWRDQ,Eugene Suh,"[1, 3]","Smallville: The Ninth Season was very dull, mundane, and just plain risible. It seems the producers of this season 9 were prodigal. Here's why:1. Lana Lang is not included in this season (yes, I understand she had to leave in season 8, but at least make a cameo appearance like her character does in the animated cartoon and comics).2. Lex Luthor is almost entirely missing in this season (we saw him ""die"" in the back of an 18-wheel truck in season 8, but he's not dead, of course), so the tension/suspense/drama between him and Clark Kent is devoid in this season (tension because he knows Clark's secret).3. There are fewer, main characters in this season and the futile attempt of the writers/producers to introduce Zod as the major villain to provide the tension that was previously in Smallville between Lex and Clark, which is what made the first 7 seasons so epic (especially season 4, 6, and 7), is laughable since Zod doesn't have the evil presence/menace that Lex has.4. Since this season was so boring and devoid of excellent writing and plots/storylines, the writers/producers desperately try to get fans to watch this pathetic season by introducing the Superman logo in the first couple episodes, as well as on Clark Kent's shirt. Granted, eventually, Clark is going to wear that symbol as part of his costume, but the smart thing to do would have been to wait until the final season (season 10) to introduce the Superman logo to bring closure to this epic show that started out slow, then became addictive in season 4, 6, 7, and 8, but dragged on through the mud in season 9 (this season).Here's why Smallville: The Ninth Season only deserves 2 stars:1. Erica Durance (she is so beautiful, it's surprising she hasn't been on Maxim and People magazine's list of the 100 most beautiful women in the world).2. The internal conflict/struggle that the Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) battles with throughout the first several episodes of this season is what makes a character and a show dramatic and interesting to watch. Any film fanatic/critic who's erudite will tell you the same (also, they'll tell you this season 9 was not worth watching).",2,"Lame, pathetic, and disappointing",1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,2150,"['Smallville', 'Ninth', 'Season', 'was', 'very', 'dull', 'mundane', 'just', 'plain', 'risible', 'producers', 'season', '9', 'were', 'prodigal', 'Here', 'why:1', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'not', 'included', 'season', 'yes', 'understand', 'had', 'leave', 'season', '8', 'least', 'make', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'character', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'comics', '.2', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'almost', 'entirely', 'missing', 'season', 'saw', 'die', 'back', '18-wheel', 'truck', 'season', '8', 'not', 'dead', 'course', 'tension/suspense/drama', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'devoid', 'season', 'tension', 'Clark', 'secret', '.3', 'are', 'fewer', 'main', 'characters', 'season', 'futile', 'attempt', 'writers/producers', 'introduce', 'Zod', 'major', 'villain', 'provide', 'tension', 'was', 'previously', 'Smallville', 'Lex', 'Clark', 'what', 'made', 'first', '7', 'seasons', 'so', 'epic', 'especially', 'season', '4', '6', '7', 'laughable', 'Zod', ""n't"", 'have', 'evil', 'presence/menace', 'Lex', 'has.4', 'season', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'devoid', 'excellent', 'writing', 'plots/storylines', 'writers/producers', 'desperately', 'try', 'get', 'fans', 'watch', 'pathetic', 'season', 'introducing', 'Superman', 'logo', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'shirt', 'Granted', 'eventually', 'Clark', 'going', 'wear', 'symbol', 'part', 'costume', 'smart', 'thing', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wait', 'final', 'season', 'season', '10', 'introduce', 'Superman', 'logo', 'bring', 'closure', 'epic', 'show', 'started', 'out', 'slow', 'then', 'became', 'addictive', 'season', '4', '6', '7', '8', 'dragged', 'mud', 'season', '9', 'season', 'why', 'Smallville', 'Ninth', 'Season', 'only', '2', 'stars:1', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'so', 'beautiful', 'surprising', ""n't"", 'been', 'Maxim', 'People', 'magazine', 'list', '100', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'world', '.2', 'internal', 'conflict/struggle', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'Oliver', 'Queen', 'first', 'several', 'episodes', 'season', 'what', 'character', 'show', 'dramatic', 'interesting', 'watch', 'film', 'fanatic/critic', 'who', 'erudite', 'will', 'tell', 'same', 'also', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'season', '9', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

1273301,A212BN81DP6FRI,B002JVWRDQ,freelancer26,"[34, 57]","At the end of Smallville's 8th season, I believed that the chemistry between Tom Welling (Clark Kent) and Erica Durance (Lois Lane) had been fired up full blast... I WAS WRONG. It did sizzle at the conclusion of Season 8 and for the first five episodes of this 9th Season. But, to my amazement, the sizzle turned into a wild fire by the end of the sixth episode, appropriately titled: Crossfire.I am a classic movie lover. In my humble opinion, most films made after 1965 are unworthy of my time and money. However, every once in a very rare while, a modern film or TV series comes along that totally captures my heart. Smallville Season 9 is one of those precious rarities. The Welling/Durance onscreen romance is something reminiscent of the films of yesteryear. Because the old studios had so much talent under long term contract, they could try out different pairings and see what struck gold: Fred and Ginger, Bogie and Bacall, Clark Gable's Rhett Butler to Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara and my personal favorite, Cary Grant and Rita Hayworth in ""Only Angels Have Wings."" It's a darn shame those two greats never made another film together. But the few scenes they did share in that film stole the spotlight from the film's actual leading lady, Jean Arthur. It catapulted Rita Hayworth to stardom until she reached iconic status in ""Gilda"" and it cemented the legendary Cary Grant sexy bravado that would serve him well for the rest of his career. Well, striking movie/TV magic is not common at all now. But, gold and platinum were, in deed struck in a serious way this year in the quiet town of Vancouver on the set of the most underappreciated, underrated and misunderestimated ;) show on television today in the form of my generation's Cary and Rita: Tom and Erica. I have to say that I admire them. We have all been witness to countless stories of indiscretions on the sets of film and tv done by actors who don't have a fraction of the chemistry that is UNDENIABLE between Welling and Durance. The will and character of these two young talents are made from tough stuff. If they weren't otherwise involved though, I'd safely bet my entire classic movie collection that these two belong to each other PERIOD.DVD Features:1. Commentary on ""Kandor"" by Callum Blue(Major Zod), writers/producers Al Septien and Turi Meyer2. Commentary on ""Idol"" by Erica Durance(Lois Lane) and showrunners Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson3.

Unaired scenes: Rabid, Roulette, Disciple, Persuasion, Conspiracy, Upgrade, Charade and Salvation6. All 22 Season 9 episodes in anamorphic widescreen on 6 discs with artwork7. Booklet with episode descriptions and dvd contentsEpisode List:1) SAVIOR: GRADE A- ...Tess is the savior of Kandor. Zod is the savior of his Kryptonian army. Chloe savior of organized hero-hood, Oliver- would-be savior down on his luck, Clark the savior of all and unbeknownst to everyone, including her, Lois the savior of Clark.2) METALLO: A ...John Corben - Brian Austin Green as I have never seen him before: confident and oozing sex appeal. After five years since Smallville's Season 4 premiere, Clark Kent finally becomes AWARE of his romantic feelings for Lois Lane.3) RABID: A++ ...Zod's minion releases zombie virus. Please, DO NOT let the gory zombie make up deter you from watching this episode. It is POWERFUL. Clark definitively and literally closes the book on Lana Lang, puts an end to the ""buddy"" relationship he maintained with Lois Lane for five long years and opens the door to his now acknowledged budding love for her. I DARE you to not cry during the rain scene! DELETED SCENES4) ECHO: A- ...Jor-El temporarily gives Clark the power to hear other's thoughts. Encouraged by the attraction for him that Lois has kept gaurded since episode 8.17 Hex, Clark asks her out on a ""not date"" reigniting her crush on him. For her own protection, he ends by standing her up and making her cry. (She shows up at the Daily Planet the next morning wearing sun glasses.) Oliver tries to kill himself.5) ROULETTE: B ...The conclusion of the Oliver downward spiral courtesy of Chloe. Clark and Lois have movie and laundry night. Clark makes Lois cry for the second episode in a row by lying to her about the seriousness of her former boyfriend Oliver's condition. DELETED SCENES6) CROSSFIRE: A++ ...Zod's new company strikes ""sun"" deal with Tess. Chloe meets her hacking match. Oliver gets a sidekick and does his best to reignite his former romance with Lois. And Clark ... he becomes a MAN (This is where Smallville's Clark FINALLY measures up to his original namesake: Clark Gable - Superman creators Siegel and Schuster named and modeled their Man of Steel after the ""King of Hollywood"" - appropriately and deservedly so). The save he does on the roof, his first and last scenes with Lois are three of my all time favorite moments from the entire series.7) KANDOR: B+ ...PRICELESS scene between Clark and Chloe discussing his first kiss with Lois. Entire desert scene is fantastic. Clark continues in his Manhood and holds his father in his arms before he dies, finally appreciating his sacrifice in sending his only son to Earth. COMMENTARY:Callum Blue(Major Zod), writers/ producers Al Septien and Turi Meyer8) IDOL: A++ ...Comic Book PERFECTION. Anne Saunders writer and Glen Winter director deserve and Emmy for this. Erica Durance and Tom Welling deserve a raise. They become the definitive, preeminent and ICONIC Clark Kent and Lois Lane - leaving all former (and quite probably, all future) incarnations in the dust. The guy who plays the D.A. is deliciously cool and sexy (in a menacing way) and Randall, the Daily Planet city editor, always has a fun and funny interaction with his star reporter.  The Wonder Twins(and their space monkey Gleek on a cell phone) make an unforgettable appearance. COMMENTARY:Erica Durance(Lois Lane)and showrunners Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson9) PANDORA: A+ ...Heart-pumping from start to finish. This is Tom Welling's best performance to date- and I'm not just talking about the Clark/Lois sex scene! This was an epic episode - sort of Smallville's version of ""Brave New Metropolis"" from Superman the Animated Series - it's only after Lois Lane's disappearance that Superman finally becomes aware of his deep love for her and resolves to actually do something about it. ALL the Tom/Erica scenes were heart-wrenching. Either these two are the best actors the whole of the world has ever seen or they are genuinely in love with each other (much like Lois and Clark were in seasons 4-8 ...everyone around them knew it except them). Not even the classic movie couples I mentioned earlier portrayed being in love as well as these two - except for Humphry Bogart and Lauren Bacall but they actually were the love of each other's lives. (They fell in love at first sight on the set of their first film, ""To Have and Have Not."" What's more, Bogart turned down the male lead opposite Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda"" - he thought her too captivating and he had just married Bacall.)10) DISCIPLE: A- ...Oliver's past comes back to bite him in the ass. Zod tries to pressure Clark through Lois. Callum Blue rivals Michael Rosenbaum as best show villain ever. He is so much fun to watch! His interactions with Clark and Lois in this and the previous episode are electrifying. They play really well off each other. Never been a Green Arrow fan, but I love Justin Hartley's take on him. He makes you want to hold him - his scenes with Lois were so tenderly bittersweet - it's no wonder she's the love of his life (that is until Black Canary comes around to ""rescue"" him). I also love the big brother/little sister relationship he's developed with Mia. I'm loving Clark more and more each episode. He is fabulous! The way he is with Lois and the way she is with him - it's like these two were magically plucked out of the 1930's-1940's and delivered to 21st century television - beautifully CLASSIC all the way! Writer/producer Jordan Hawley always seems to write an intense Oliver Queen, a clear-headed Clark Kent and a very vulnerable Lois Lane. DELETED SCENES11) SOCIETY (ABSOLUTE JUSTICE Part 1): A- ...The Justice Society of America led by Hawkman is forced out of retirement by a covert government agency. This episode dragged for the first 30 minutes until Dr.Fate showed up in full uniform. Actor Brent Stait (Dr. Fate) was hands down the MVP. He OWNED every one of his scenes.12) LEGENDS (ABSOLUTE JUSTICE Part 2): A+ ...Of all the ""Smallville University"" alumni, director Tom Welling has become its brightest graduate. After his dismal ""Injustice"" episode last year, he is back to form here. The action sequences are among the series' best and his Lois Lane is always at her sexiest and most vulnerable in his hands. Writer Geoff Johns outdid himself. He clearly loves the material and adores Lois Lane in particular. Her scene with Dr.Fate was simply AWESOME. One thing, though - this is the second episode where Clark strikes a ""Hercules statue"" pose during an action scene (the first was Disciple). Unless he's doing this on purpose, he really needs to quit it because he looks like he's air jogging - it's laugh out loud HILARIOUS!13) WARRIOR: C- ...Director Alison Mack and writer Brian Miller ruined the Zatanna character with this one episode. I liked her in last year's ""Hex"" but here, they portrayed her as a cheap, selfish, domineering slut. Even more annoying was Mack's attempt to regress Clark to clueless wuss of seasons 1-8. I do understand the choice of Zatanna to be the troublemaker to the iconic romance, though. Other than Laura Vandervoort who played Clark's cousin, Serinda Swan is the only other actress to ever appear on the show who is as beautiful as Erica Durance so Lois was believably jealous. Thankfully, Lois dressed as Wonder Woman and the Tom/Erica chemistry came to the rescue and made this episode somewhat bearable. However, I DO hope this is Mack's last season on the show - I've never been a fan of her Chloe. Superman does NOT need a controlling ""sidekick,"" a fascist ""Watchtower,"" or a hypocritical ""best friend."" Producers, in the name of all that is the excellence of the Superman story, get rid of her already!!!!14) PERSUASION: A- ...Clark is infected by gemstone kryptonite giving him the power of persuasion. Though every one of his persuasive instances backfire on him, three good things do come out - 1.Tess learns that Clark's power will disappear if her towers go online 2.Chloe shows her true colors 3.Lois opens up to Clark causing them to draw closer. BEAUTIFULLY written and directed episode by Anne Saunders and Christopher Petry. Louis Febre outdid himself with the musical score. This is the best Clark Kent character advancement story thus far. DELETED SCENES15) CONSPIRACY: B+ ...A doctor the Kandorians experimented on takes revenge by abducting three of them. Then, he kidnaps Lois Lane to get her to write about the alien invasion. Zod tracks them down, gets shot, then Clark shows up in time to save his life, though it ends up having major, unforeseen repercussions. Clark and Lois agree to keep some mystery in their romance since both are aware of secrets neither is willing to share. The Tom/Erica chemistry comes to a level of mature sexiness. DELETED SCENES16) ESCAPE: B- ...Clark sings about Lois in the shower! HA!! It's the funniest scene ever! This is the first Chloe-centric episode in the show's history that I actually didn't mind because it's sprinkled with GOLDEN Clark/Lois scenes and it establishes the actual nature of each couple on the show for the rest of the season - Tess/Zod:Power merger; Chloe/Oliver:Friends with benefits; Lois/Clark:Old fashioned romantic love. Zod changes his strategy for world domination by impersonating the Blur. Actress Odessa Rae has a dual role as the inn keeper and the Silver Banshee. She underplayed both parts very nicely and effectively.17) CHECKMATE: B+ ...It appears that the powers that be on the show are now trying to turn Oliver and Chloe into ""Lois and Clark the Sequel."" It's not working. Hartley's and Mack's interaction with each other is just - blah. In truth, Oliver's scenes with Tess had much more spark and were considerably MUCH MORE fun to watch. Clark's action sequence was the highlight - it really did look like a comic book page come to life. However, Clark targetting Tess in every episode has gotten old and it was just plain STUPID to have him, yet again, throw a TOTALLY UNNECESSARY apology at Chloe of all people! The best part of this episode was the Martian Manhunter as played by Phil Morris. Hoped he'd be a regular next season (In the animated ""Justice League"" series, Jonn Jonz was in charge of the Watchtower)...by now it became obvious that shrump chloe was the writers' pride and joy - they should have just spared us millions of Superman fans and written a seperate show exclusively for her few thousand fans.18) UPGRADE: B+ ...Brian Austin Green returns as John Corben/Metallo. It's amazing how actress Erica Durance seems to have a special gift for generating chemistry with every one of the male actors she has ever been paired up with on this show. Green's chemistry with her is really good - not off the charts, smoldering perfection like Welling's but REALLY good, nonetheless. In fact, it's as good as the Lois/Oliver vibe of season 6. Once this show wraps, I hope they do a dramatic movie together. The first four minutes of this episode are killer! There's only one Clark/Lois scene but it's one of the BEST! Michael Rohl, who also directed ""Rabid"" and ""Crossfire,"" seems to have the best handle on how to create the sexiest of all Lane/Kent moments. And, writers Andrew Landis and Julia Swift (who also penned ""Pandora"") have earned their stripes in writing Clark Kent's manhood at its RAWEST. Officially went way over in setting Chloe on a pedestal but - whatever - that Clark/Lois ""wake up call"" scene was just TOO GOOD!!! DELETED SCENES19) CHARADE: A- ...Clark is jealous of himself - bringing the perrenial Superman/Clark Kent/Lois Lane ""Triangle Built for Two"" to Smallville. Lois in a playboy bunny suit. Tess, like the rest of us, is baffled why heroes keep Chloe around. Guest star Dylan Neal (Ray Sacks) is really HOT - for an older guy. And executive producer and showrunner Brian Peterson makes his directorial debut. Writers/producers Holly Henderson and Don Whitehead wrote this as a sequel to the season's earlier episode, ""Idol."" All the scenes with Clark and/or Lois felt like an old-fashioned, classic Superman show - and that is a high compliment. DELETED SCENES20) SACRIFICE: B+ ...Checkmate forces a Watchtower meltdown while Tess and Chloe are trapped inside. Tess names Chloe Plain Jane. Zod destroys Checkmate Headquarters. Major Zod becomes the full on, sadistic ""General Zod"" by killing his pregnant lover, Faeora, because she refused to kneel before him. Then, he unites his army and gives them all super powers. In short, all hell breaks loose.21) HOSTAGE: A- ...Annette O'Toole returns as Martha Kent (the Red Queen) and her real-life husband, Michael McKean returns as Perry White. The future Daily Planet Editor-in-Chief meets intrepid reporter Lois Lane. Jor-El's ace card against Zod's superpowered army ""the Book of Rao"" is recovered by the Red Queen (Ma Kent) and she gives it to her son, Clark - but with a warning.22) SALVATION: A++ ...Opening teaser genuinely ICONIC sequence. The Justice League and the Justice Society unite in cameos. MAGNIFICENT season finale. Producers/writers Al Septien and Turi Meyer also wrote season 7's best episode, ""Apocalypse."" Greg Beeman (Seasons 1-5 veteran director/producer) returned to helm this episode. His love and respect for the show, the characters and the actors shined through. He lovingly framed each scene with care, style and precision. WELL DONE! These were, quite simply, the GREATEST 22 hours of Superman entertainment EVER put on screen - and he hasn't even worn the suit yet. DELETED SCENESDirected at Erica Durance - should she ever read this: You once said in an interview that three actresses you admired were angelina jolie, jessica lange and ashley judd. I whole-heartedly hope that the day will come when you stop holding those three as your standards for acting success. Granted, that they have managed to gain name recognition and carve out a fan base for themselves. However, in all honesty, they don't hold a candle to what has been divinely gifted to you: a presence and inner radiance that harkens Ginger Rogers, Hedy Lamarr and especially, Rita Hayworth. If you must have acting role models, I wish you'll look to these truly great ladies whose legend has stood the test of time and are still the measure for cinematic grace, beauty and womanly grit. With all due respect, those three you mentioned will be eventually forgotten or, at best, thrown on the pile of dime a dozen performers who care more about their liberal political standing and panhandeling to the elite critics and ""method"" actor house of worship than they do about the art and joy of cinema and the respect owed to its audience. I hope you nurture your spirit, your heart, your connection to God and untether yourself from those who would use you to benefit themselves while holding you back and even bringing you harm. True love is not blind nor brainless, foolish, selfish, fearful, or cruel and will never ask you to allow something that will cause you embarrassment and leave you vulnerable to needless criticism. If ever in doubt, examine your own experience as Lois with Superman. You don't need to rely on ham actors and talent-poor wannabe ""film makers"" to empower yourself to draw from the natural wealth of talent deposited in you for acting, producing and you should try your own hand at writing and directing. It's because of your innate character that you embodied Lois Lane from the very first scene but it wasn't until Welling worked with you in Season 7 ""Apocalypse"" and Michael Rohl worked with you in Season 8 ""Bloodline"" that your raw talent for comedy and drama began to mature before our eyes. Mistakes are a fact of life but setting things right is what takes us from mediocrity to greatness. Respectfully, all the best to you.Directed at Tom Welling - should he ever read this: I'm sorry it took 8 years for me to become one of your fans but really, the fault lies with your seasons 1-8 writers/producers and your seasons 1-8 performance as Clark Kent. Your show's original theme, ""Before Superman"" was fine for the first 5 seasons and while season 6 gave hope that the show was moving to the next stage in Superman's development (i.e. Justice League, Jimmy Olsen, kissing Lois Lane and her becoming a reporter)season 7 backslided in most of what had been accomplished. Except for Lois at the Daily Planet, Michael Cassidy (After you in Season 9, THE most gorgeous man to ever grace the Smallville screen!), Supergirl and the directed-by-you episode ""Apocalypse"" - all of season 7 really, really sucked ROTTEN eggs! With the exodus of Al, Miles, Glover, Kreuk and Rosenbaum, my hope was renewed that Superman was finally on the horizon. Season 8's episodes 1-11 were the most promising string of stories in your show's history UP TO THAT POINT but then your ""supergenius"" show runners took a hatchet to their own show and maliciously destroyed all the good progress that had been made with the incredibly horrendous episodes 12-14. The Mack-directed-episode 8.13 Power was PARTICULARLY HORRIBLE!!! Your hack producers claimed that it was ""female empowerment"" themed. Uh, well, speaking as a young, empowered woman myself, I can tell you that to portray a woman who feels soooo inferior to the man she loves that she makes the conscious, deliberate decision to LITERALLY turn herself inside out in a desperate attempt to be his equal is not only SOOOO NOT empowering but it is morosely tragic and insulting!!! It simply had no place in the Superman story. Why? Did you let them do that?! Except for ""Hex,"" ""Stiletto"" and your confession scene with Erica in ""Infamous,"" the rest of the season really sucked and your Clark went back to being a (super) dork! I almost wished that Durance's Lois Lane move to Gotham City to date Batman because your seasons 1-8 Clark most certainly did NOT deserve her!! Superman was NEVER supposed to be an enabler of twisted behavior! He loves and celebrates all good women just as they are - especially his INHERENT equal, Lois Lane. Lois is to Wonder Woman what Batman is to Superman - the mortal versions of the most powerful, heroic figures in the world. Ms.Lane has never needed and never will need an artificial, skin-grafted ""super suit"" to stand toe to toe with her Man of Steel. Perhaps the only redeeming quality of that miserably misguided arc is Smallville's(inadvertant) point that Lana Lang was, is and always will be Clark's toxic kryptonite whereas Lois Lane was, is and forever will be Superman's strengthening, life-giving, human, yellow sun... Enter Season 9. Clark Kent is NOW assertive, passionate, full of conviction, intelligent, sexy, proactive and most phenomenally, emotionally strong -in other words, the male version of Lois Lane. One of your producers said that Season 9 Clark met HIS match in Lois. I couldn't disagree with that more. I see it as Season 9 Clark FINALLY embracing his core essence and thus became HER match in the process. Wow. For a guy who started this show not even being a Superman fan, with your role as co-executive producer, director and now STELLAR performance this season, you have become Superman's greatest fan and for that, I am grateful. Now, if you're interested in keeping me as your fan, here are some suggestions: #1 You being a private person is a good thing. I don't need to know too much about you. I'm glad you're taking a cue from the classic conservative stars of Hollywood's Golden Age. #2 Please, NEVER disrespect me by trying to set yourself up as the head of a ""Tom Welling political voting block."" (That's how Brandon Routh lost my fandom - permanently.)As the private citizen that you are, if you want to start endorsing politicians or become one yourself, it's your right - just don't count on my vote (especially if you turn out to be a closet liberal). Take a page from the great Ronald Reagan - choose entertainment OR politics and you may do each well but please don't mix them. #3 Please. PLEASE. NEVER stop being a gentleman. They seem so rare now a days both in real life and entertainment. That's why I mostly stick with pre 1965 classic movies. It may be an unpopular view but the truth is, they DON'T make them like they used to. But, hey, here's hoping you and the beautiful Erica Durance can start a new trend, or rather ... bring back a classic. And, here's hoping you capture lightning in a bottle two seasons in a row with season 10 - which I hope will end with Erica Durance in a wedding dress and of course you flying in the classic Superman suit. (A Louis Febre version of John Williams' Lois/Superman theme music will be nice, too.) All in all, well done, Smallville. Well done.",5,The Season I Fell in Love With Tom Welling and Fell in Love All Over Again With Superman and Lois Lane,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,23231,"['end', 'Smallville', '8th', 'season',

1273307,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B002JVWRDQ,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[3, 7]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe ninth season of ""Smallville"" is loaded with episodes that are either very good or great, with maybe three shows(literally) that are awful.The season kicks off with ""Savior,"" a show that does not feature Clark strongly but is a great introduction for (at first)Major Zod.  Here played by very talented British actor Callum Blue, this season marks the first time the iconic ""Superman"" villain has truly appeared on the series(he was first mentioned in Season Five, and very briefly played by Lex Luthor actor Michael Rosenbaum at the end of Season Five and the beginning of Season Six).  Zod's interactions with the show's resident conflicted antagonist Tess Mercer in this episode and throughout the season are fun to watch.Other highlights for the season include ""Metallo,"" in which Brian Austin Green(""Beverly Hills 90210,"" ""Terminator:  The Sarah Connor Chronicles"") plays the ""Superman"" antagonist very well.  Other great episodes include ""Crossfire"" and ""Idol,"" the latter episode featuring the Wonder Twins Zan and Jayna for the first time on ""Smallville.""  I had real doubts about this pair on the show, but it works beautifully.  ""Charade"" is a magnificent introduction for comic book character Maxwell Lord, and ""Hostage"" returns to Mr. Lord and also brings back two longtime favorites who had been absent from the show.  Additionally, ""Absolute Justice"" is a series milestone.  Two episodes (""Society and ""Legends"")seamlessly woven into the series' first genuine two-hour episode by comic book writer Geoff Johns, it is an awesome event that also features Pam Grier as villain Amanda Waller.The three weakest episodes of the season are ""Rabid,"" ""Warrior,"" and ""Escape.""  These shows are a bad combination of trite and offensive which stick out badly in an otherwise terrific season.Also featuring a great season finale called ""Salvation"" and notably the first season to give star Tom Welling official producing credits, the ninth season of ""Smallville"" is virtually flawless.",5,"Zod finally debuts(for real this time) and ""Smallville"" delivers a great ninth season",1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,2003,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThe', 'ninth', 'season', 'Smallville', 'loaded', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'maybe', 'three', 'shows', 'literally', 'are', 'awful.The', 'season', 'kicks', 'off', 'Savior', 'show', 'not', 'feature', 'Clark', 'strongly', 'great', 'introduction', 'first', 'Major', 'Zod', 'Here', 'played', 'very', 'talented', 'British', 'actor', 'Callum', 'Blue', 'season', 'first', 'time', 'iconic', 'Superman', 'villain', 'truly', 'appeared', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'mentioned', 'Season', 'Five', 'very', 'briefly', 'played', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'end', 'Season', 'Five', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Six', 'Zod', 'interactions', 'show', 'resident', 'conflicted', 'antagonist', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'episode', 'season', 'are', 'fun', 'watch.Other', 'highlights', 'season', 'include', 'Metallo', 'Brian', 'Austin', 'Green', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'Terminator', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'Chronicles', 'Superman', 'antagonist', 'very', 'well', 'Other', 'great', 'episodes', 'include', 'Crossfire', 'Idol', 'latter', 'episode', 'featuring', 'Wonder', 'Twins', 'Zan', 'Jayna', 'first', 'time', 'Smallville', 'had', 'real', 'doubts', 'pair', 'show', 'beautifully', 'Charade', 'magnificent', 'introduction', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'Maxwell', 'Lord', 'Hostage', 'returns', 'Mr.', 'Lord', 'also', 'back', 'two', 'longtime', 'favorites', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'absent', 'show', 'Additionally', 'Absolute', 'Justice', 'series', 'milestone', 'Two', 'episodes', 'Society', 'Legends', 'seamlessly', 'woven', 'series', 'first', 'genuine', 'two-hour', 'episode', 'comic', 'book', 'writer', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'awesome', 'event', 'also', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'villain', 'Amanda', 'Waller.The', 'three', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'Rabid', 'Warrior', 'Escape', 'shows', 'are', 'bad', 'combination', 'trite', 'offensive', 'stick', 'out', 'badly', 'otherwise', 'terrific', 'season.Also', 'featuring', 'great', 'season', 'finale', 'called', 'Salvation', 'notably', 'first', 'season', 'give', 'star', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'official', 'producing', 'credits', 'ninth', 'season', 'Smallville', 'virtually', 'flawless']",N/A
1273308,A1MAG8BDOVJHTT,B002JVWRDQ,"G. Swift ""97jedi""","[2, 3]","Having cruised through the DVDs already, the ninth season is a good one. The overall season arc of the Kandorians under Major Zod is not as strong as some prior seasons' storylines, but this season's true gems are the budding romance between Clark and Lois and the high quality of the individual episodes. The quest to stop the future that Lois is returning keeps popping up as well, along with character arcs for Oliver Queen and his Green Arrow persona and a seeming disregard for civil liberties by Chloe Sullivan.In particular, we start getting more of the characters from the DC Universe making their appearances. We get a classic Superman villain in Metallo, though they might have chosen a better actor to play this kryptonite-hearted baddie. Still, the character design was nice, typically with a Smallville flavor instead of being a direct translation of the comic version. The Justice Society, at least in part, makes an appearance that stops the presses at the midpoint of the season. We also get the Martian Manhunter, who is far too underused for an actor of Phil Morris' caliber, doing his cavalry impersonation, which is nice. Even the Wonder Twins, much improved over their old Superfriends cartoon incarnation, though still bumbling in their hero worship, play a part in this season.The special features are nowhere near as good as in prior seasons. There are deleted scenes from 8 of the 21 episodes, but most of these are just a few seconds. The commentaries are OK, but again, without the liveliness of the early sets, and far less entertaining. Still, the discs are good transfers of the episodes, which is the primary purpose. While some blooper reels would be nice, or perhaps some more cut scenes and more actors on the commentaries, there's not much one could do to improve this set. (It's so nice to have a ""Play"" option and not have to go to each episode's individual menu to play them, which too many shows still do on their DVDs.)",4,"Great season, DVDs could use more features",1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,1959,"['Having', 'cruised', 'DVDs', 'already', 'ninth', 'season', 'good', 'one', 'overall', 'season', 'arc', 'Kandorians', 'Major', 'Zod', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'prior', 'seasons', 'storylines', 'season', 'true', 'gems', 'are', 'budding', 'romance', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'high', 'quality', 'individual', 'episodes', 'quest', 'stop', 'future', 'Lois', 'returning', 'keeps', 'popping', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'arcs', 'Oliver', 'Queen', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'persona', 'seeming', 'disregard', 'civil', 'liberties', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan.In', 'particular', 'start', 'getting', 'more', 'characters', 'DC', 'Universe', 'making', 'appearances', 'get', 'classic', 'Superman', 'villain', 'Metallo', 'might', 'have', 'chosen', 'better', 'actor', 'play', 'kryptonite-hearted', 'baddie', 'Still', 'character', 'design', 'was', 'nice', 'typically', 'Smallville', 'flavor', 'instead', 'being', 'direct', 'translation', 'comic', 'version', 'Justice', 'Society', 'least', 'part', 'appearance', 'presses', 'midpoint', 'season', 'also', 'get', 'Martian', 'Manhunter', 'who', 'far', 'too', 'underused', 'actor', 'Phil', 'Morris', 'caliber', 'doing', 'cavalry', 'impersonation', 'nice', 'Even', 'Wonder', 'Twins', 'much', 'improved', 'over', 'old', 'Superfriends', 'cartoon', 'incarnation', 'still', 'bumbling', 'hero', 'worship', 'play', 'part', 'season.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'prior', 'seasons', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', '8', '21', 'episodes', 'most', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'commentaries', 'are', 'OK', 'again', 'liveliness', 'early', 'sets', 'far', 'less', 'entertaining', 'Still', 'discs', 'are', 'good', 'transfers', 'episodes', 'primary', 'purpose', 'blooper', 'reels', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'perhaps', 'more', 'cut', 'scenes', 'more', 'actors', 'commentaries', 'not', 'much', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'improve', 'set', 'so', 'nice', 'have', 'Play', 'option', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'episode', 'individual', 'menu', 'play', 'too', 'many', 'shows', 'still', 'do', 'DVDs']",N/A

This is the longest running Superman television series (Sorry, ""Lois & Clark"") and continues into its ninth season which is an amazing achievement. The series developed by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar based on the DC Comics characters will be beginning its tenth and final season this fall focusing on the man becoming Superman.Starring Tom Welling as Clark Kent, his character finally makes his first attempts to embrace his hero birthright and calling. It turns out in season 9 that Planet Earth is such a fabulous place that other Kryptonians want to move into the neighborhood and call it home. Of course, they don't want to share, but take control. Clark sends a warning to Zod and his followers, particularly if they try to ensnare Lois Lane played by Erica Durance in their pursuits.More characters from the DC Universe show up to add a little something extra like the shape-shifting Wonder Twins, the magical Zatanna, and in the double episode, the Justice Society of America's Doctor Fate, Hawkman, and Stargirl.Bonus Features:There are two featurettes, one is ""Kneel Before Zod"" which is an in-depth look at this Kryptonian criminal and his beginnings in the DC Silver Age, and his appearances in film, animation, and live-action television. The other featurette is ""Justice For All"" where the ""Smallville"" creative team as they discuss bringing the Justice Society of America team of superheroes to television for the first time.There are two episodes with cast and creator commentaries on ""Idol"" and ""Kandor.""

A girlfriend once labeled Welling's acting as ""reserved,"" but let us not talk falsely now. It also doesn't sit well that the show is taking its sweet time with Clark's evolution to the Big Red S. I do think the move to Metropolis was a step forward. I won't go into the soap opera content. But Superman's got no business being in THE O.C.This ninth season revolves around several threads. Major Zod and his troop of fellow Kandorians have descended on Metropolis on a quest to turn Earth's yellow sun to red so that they could gain otherworldly abilities. The vacuously-named mystery man, the ""Red-Blue Blur,"" continues to protect Metropolis. Chloe Sullivan, who has developed into a darker character, is still trying to get the band together, the band, of course, projected as this reality's Justice League. Clark Kent and Lois Lane continue their cautious circling around each other. Intimacy is hard to achieve when both parties have built up so many defensive walls. I like what Erica Durance does with her character. Lois is appropriately spunky and obnoxious and vulnerable and lovable. And she never stops talking.What made me check out SMALLVILLE again after so long is the show's steady increase in featuring DC properties. I glommed onto Season 8 because of the ""Legion"" episode. Season 9 turned my head strictly because of the episode ""Absolute Justice,"" which by the way is gratifyingly excellent. It's no secret that SMALLVILLE is more an Elseworlds-type reality than a reflection of DC's ongoing continuity. As such, I do relish the changes invoked regarding these halfway familiar characters. And, as for Clark Kent himself, he's one step closer to putting on the flashy red and blue tights. If nothing else, that Season 10 is the final season seems to be galvanizing the writers to get a move on already. How much longer will they allow the Red-Blah-Blah to go around gigged out in an uber-lame black trench coat that even Neo thinks is played out?And what's a show like this without a covert organization mucking things up? The shadowy agency called Checkmate makes its debut, headed up by the calculating Amanda Waller (Pam Grier) and numbering Maxwell Lord as one of its agents. Checkmate is intent on countering some sort of impending alien invasion. It's pretty decent foreshadowing.I have several favorite episodes from Season 9, and these all involve SMALLVILLE's expanding its universe to explore its DC roots. ""Crossfire"" features Green Arrow's mentoring of soiled dove/cage fighter Mia Dearden (readers of Green Arrow's comic book know her as ""Speedy""). ""Idol"" introduces the Wonder Twins, and I grinned real big when the twins bumped fists and said: ""Powers, activate!"" ""Warrior"" presents a twist on the Shazam! story and also the return of Zatanna.For JSA fiends ""Absolute Justice"" is must-see viewing. ""Absolute Justice"" is SMALLVILLE at its most comic-booky, with the added bonus of Geoff Johns having scripted the thing. It's neat to see the Justice Society treated with proper awe and reverence, and comic book fans will geek out on all the Easter eggs the episode throws in. Even Ma Hunkel gets a cameo. But I wasn't really sold until Dr. Fate spoke with that grand, solemn delivery of his. And while I did have reservations regarding Hawkman's costume (I thought the cuirass looked cheesy and the wings were a bit too stiff), I thought the winged wonder comes off really well. I don't know, though, that Carter Hall needed to channel Christian Bale's voice whenever he becomes Hawkman. Also, I enjoyed the instant rivalry that surfaced between Hawkman and Green Arrow (this being true to the comics, by the way). And I can't wait to see more of Star Girl. So, for now, I'm back in the fold and tuning in to Season 10. Maybe it's not too little too late, after all.SMALLVILLE - THE COMPLETE NINTH SEASON offers the following bonus material: audio commentary on the episodes ""Kandor"" (with actor Callum Blue and executive producers Turi Meyer and Al Septien) and ""Idol"" (with actress Erica Durance and executive producers Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson); Deleted/Unaired Scenes from 8 episodes: ""Rabid,"" Roulette,"" ""Disciple,"" ""Persuasion,"" ""Conspiracy,"" ""Upgrade,"" ""Charade,"" and ""Salvation""; ""Kneel Before Zod"" - a featurette exploring the evolution of Superman's classic foe (00:15:12 minutes long); ""Absolute Justice: From Script to Screen"" - a featurette going into the process of marrying the JSA into the SMALLVILLE universe (00:29:28 minutes).",4,Tom Welling must kneel before

It's about as good as all the other seasons were.  Honestly, while I know that they had to follow Superman lore in pairing Lois Lane and Superhottie, I really HATE IT!  I think Lana Lang looked much better dangling from his arm---and I do mean dangllllliiiiinnnngggg.  That is something that I believe is finally being corrected in this mini Super saga.  The writers and directors aren't playing relationship cat and mouse between Lois and Clark quite as much as they did with Lana and Clark.  I was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sick of it.  Let the boy catch the girl and keep her for awhile sheesh.  What I don't like about season 9 (and season 8) is the way they drewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww outtttttttttttttttttt in slooooooooooooooow mooooootion, the Oliver Queen brooding bad boy, ""I hate myself so much for killing Lex"" story line.  Enough with the whining Ollie--you killed Lex, get OVER IT ALREADY!!! Penance doesn't suit you!  Leave that to SuperHottie.  Apart from the season story line itself, I am very very unhappy with the disc protection or rather lack thereof in this set.  They've changed it in the last two seasons and it really stinks.  It falls apart much too easily.  I would have thought it was just the fault of the first seller I purchased from, but when I received the season 9 discs, the inner system was falling apart there too.

1273333,A2S9P70216QC2H,B002JVWRDQ,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[6, 9]","Season Review:After quite probably the most disappointing finale of the series (""Doomsday"") Fans and especially myself, wondered where the series would go from here. Season 8 showed a lot of quality and promirise, ultimately ending in mediocrity. Thankfully with ""Savior"", the writers picked up the series after another slump and fans quickly realized we might be in for an awesome season and was it ever. With Season 8 being a light-hearted, hopeful season, Season 9 explored Clark taking a darker turn as Metropolis' protector. Ditching the red and blue and simply be called ""The Blur"", we saw a more proactive and driven Clark then we've ever seen before. Not to mention, he made himself a costume and while most will agure about it's Matrix/the Punisher knock-off appeal, the fact that Clark was finally wearing the House of El symbol on his chest showed a significant amount of growth and change in the character. Not to mention, it's just epic!With Lana Lang days officially behind us (thank God!), Clark's relationship with Lois as well as Lois herself were given much more development this season than previous. While we got some great Clois interaction in Season 8, Season 9 finally saw the iconic duo in a relationship and luckily, the witty banter and amazing chemistry between Tom Welling and Erica Durance never waivered nor weakened because of it. If anything, it made their relationship more mature, complex and a lot more interesting than Clark and Lana's tiresome back and forth romance. It was great having Lois officially claiming her spot as Superman's leading lady as well as having her be the center of the story arc for a good portion of the season. During the first half, Lois returns with horrifying visions from being sent to the future and everyone is curious to see just what exactly the future holds, especially a worried Clark who was told by Alia, a kryptonian assassin from the future, that he would destory the world. It's an intriguing and exciting storyline that ultimately ends in the rather average futuristic epic ""Pandora"". While the visuals are strong, the conclusion of this part of the season's arc was lacking in execution and only added to some irritating plotholes.The return of Zod, while had most dreading his re-appearence, soon had everyone picked in interest again after Callum Blue's commanding performance as the future villain in the premiere. Callum really brought a lot of passion and presence to the role that hasn't been seen in a villain since the Lex/Lionel days. Watching this Major Zod develop into the villain we knew from Superman II was fun to watch as well as Zod's nemesis interplay with Tess. Cassidy Freedman returns as villainess heiress to the Luthor dynasty and this time her motives are more blurry than before. Tess spends most of the season playing both sides, which was entertaining in some episodes and just plain annoying in others. Nevertheless, the inconsistency of writing for the character was made up by Cassidy's solid performances. Justin Hartley returns as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, this time more emo than last season's first half. While Hartley does well with the material, the first few episodes watching Oliver's depression quickly grow tired and repetitive. The dark oliver arc concludes in the ridiculously concieved ""Roulette"" yet only to be brought back in yet ""been there, done that"" episode, ""Disciple"". Oliver also in the wake of his new awakening takes up in apprentice in Mia Dearden aka Speedy #2. While Mia is a decent enough character, she is ultimately underused and underwritten in the episodes she appears in (""Crossfire"" and ""Disciple"") Other weak links in the season was the cartoony and embarassing episode ""Warrior"" which puts a Captain Marvel spin on the Warrior Angel comics of the series and tells a laugable tale with Chloe pratically hitting on a 12 year old boy turned cheesy superhero. Speaking of Chloe, she is the weakest aspect of the season in my opnion. Clark and Chloe developed some animosity between them during the season after the events of Season 8's finale, but it only further to make Chloe look bad because of it. Here actions at the end of last season left her with no consequences and it seems she was on a mission to gain a God complex with Watchtower, the new superhero operation developed by Chloe where heroes can call home as well as use it's technology to save the day, but Chloe only uses it for her personal motives to keep a watchful eye on everyone around her and gains a slef-righteous side where she doesn't trust Clark's decisions anymore. It's far cry from the Chloe we knew and loved from Season 5-7 and I couldn't mostly anything she did this season.But Season 9, despite all that, gave some of the best batch of Smallville episodes, storytelling, guest stars and developments in years. We're given an excellent villain birth in ""Metallo"", which tells the gruesome story of how John Corben became the kryptonite powered cyborg. Sarah Conner Chronicles/Beverly Hills 90210's Brian Austin Green is fantastic as Corben and is one of the series' most memorable villains. He returns with an even stronger performance in ""Upgrade"", if only the episode was a worthy sequel. Unlike the Doomsday arc which started off well and ended in contrivance, The Zod/Kandorians arc build at a steady pace, with some new development bringing a new twist to the storyline. Not to mention in the heroic and daring season 9 ender, ""Salvation"" all the season's arc conclude in a classic Smallville fashion including an iconic flashfoward, tremendous character development, amazing visuals, suspenseful cliffhangers and this time, a truly epic fight between Clark and Zod. Other memorable episodes are the  terrific horror romance ""Rabid"", the Toyman sequel ""Echo"", the legendary kiss we've been waiting for in the lovely ""Crossfire"", Julian Sands gives a tour de force performance as Jor-El in the spectacular ""Kandor"", the Superman inspired ""Idol"", The stylized, action packed ""Checkmate"", the heartbreaking Lois and Clark episode ""Charade"", the suspensful, plot thickening ""Sacrifice"", Annette O Toole and Michael McKean return as Martha Kent and Perry White in the heartwarming back to basics(ish) episode ""Hostage"" and I can't forget to mention the 2 part movie event ""Absolute Justice"", which features the introduction of the Justice Society of America. It's a comic book epic like never before and utilizes the core cast of the series as well as it's guest stars Michael Shanks (Cart Hall/Hawkman), Britt Irvin (Courtney Whitmore/Stargirl) and Brent Strait (Kent Nelson/Dr. Fate) each breathed life into their respected chaarcters. We were also introduced to the villainous organization, Checkmate, lead by Amanda Waller, played by 70s icon Pan Grier. It was an good storyline left open ended toward the end of the season and hopefully we'll see more of Pam's diva(ish) take of the infamous comic book villainess and her governement empire.Season 9 is, in my opinion, the strongest season since the early years. We got more plot development from Clark, a better version of Zod, much more Superman inspired moments/dialogue and a stunning conclusion that left many fans anticipating the 10th and final season (which has just begun, ""Lazarus"" was great!)Rating-8.5/10Video and Audio:All 21 Season 9 episodes are presented in HD widescreen and the episodes looked so good, it felt like I was watching new episodes all over again! The audio was also great.Rating-8.5/10Extras:More effort was put into the special featurettes. We have two documentaries on Zod and Absolute Justice. Both were very in-depth, with great info on the characters comic book history and what they mean to the comics and the legend of Superman. Although, the commentaries were average, with Callum Blue giving decent commentary on 'Kandor"" and Erica Druance is pretty hilarious during the ""Idol"" commentary, but I would have loved a commentary on ""Hostage"" by Anette O Toole and Michael McKean and especially commentary by Greg Beeman and Tom Welling on ""Salvation"". But I guess not, sigh. Also the deleted scenes are worst then useless. All of them are worthless except for the ones for ""Conspiracy"".Rating-7.5/10Overall Rating: 8/10",5,Clark's Darkest Hour and Kandor Survives-Smallville's Complete Ninth Season,1285545600,"09 27,

No offense, ladies, but the generic male audience isn't as concerned with the myriad love triangles throughout the series, and giving the women in Clark Kent's life the ability to go through time, or train to be assassins... well, it's a departure. I can see why people were so turned off by this series as a whole.That said, the middle seasons of this series tended to go further &#34;out there&#34; and gave fans the basis for what is happening in these later seasons. It's not so much that we watch this and have a sudden moment of clarity (there aren't many &#34;THAT'S why that happened two seasons ago!&#34; moments -- which makes me wonder how much foresight the writers possessed) but we're just more prepared for some of the weirdness that takes place in the 9th season.Also, it should be noted that there seems to be a heavy Buffy/Whedon influence by this point.One-off episodes are sprinkled throughout, and while they're tapping into at-the-moment mainstream, these episodes are written into the storyline.This review is meandering! Argh. But it's befitting for this item.My recommendation: if you enjoyed the past few seasons, this season is a step up. If you disliked the last few, but enjoyed the first few?

I dont want to sound like a male shovanist but I agree with the one view the women in the show are over the top. they all seem to be bruce lee, shena worrer, from hell type and the only men to beat them usally have powers of some sort. even cloe who got a little dark in the last few season kicks some ass. let c tess mercer as the new lex that sucks she's no lex luther dont know how they came up with a women villian to take lex's spot. I guess she coulnt fill the shoes of lex unless she was a judo master. then their lois who went from simple reporter woman to an army brate. tought by special forces, green berret, navy seals so she has to kick a lot of ass. but still gets knocked out a lot when clark has to show his stuff. thier's just too many I guess modern tv women on the show that seems to kick the ass of the low to middeum guards and other men on the show. and its the end of the last season and clark still cant fly. I mean they did one episode at the begging where they tried to explain why he cant. but ever person from crypton get to earth and they are like birds they start flying right away. I wish it was like the superman movie where zod and his peopl come to earth but dont know about there powers yet or what they can do. but clark seems to be the only one from crypton whose in the dark about his abilites. hell even mrs kent got some kick ass she went from small town wife to a gun packing secret agent. I dont know whats in the shows futher for season 10 since tess has wimped out and she not the super bitch she was shes more like a wimpy bitch now. maybe its because zod may be the new villian with his powers and all and tess my be leaving the show. cloe and clark are the two original still left on the show and I hope she stays around. I just want to c some real women on the show not the 2010 women that networks are putting all over the place. man kicking abilities and a bitchy attitude every now and then just beacuse they can. and its time for clark to fly. I miss the cryptonight humans that clark use to fight havent seen any of them in a while. that whole army of super humans that lex use to collet when no where I mean they had a few of them show up in season 8 but thats it . wheres the rest of them. but anyway I'll continue to watch the show and be a fan of it. maybe since this is suppose to be the last season of supernatural smallville will return to the top of my list of show to watch every week.",4,a good show losing some mometum,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,3039,"['really', 'smallville', 'wathc', 'start', 'was', 'first', 'list', 'shows', 'watch', 'then', 'feel', 'second', 'supernatual', 'liked', 'evenly', 'second', 'season', 'supernaural', 'think', 'was', 'long', 'breaks', 'inbetween', 'season', 'was', 'force', 'watch', 'reruns', 'id', 'rather', 'watch', 'reruns', 'supernatural', 'smallville', 'got', 'burt', 'out', 'smallville', 'reruns', 'could', 'wathc', 'about', 'two', 'three', 'shows', 'day', 'differnt', 'channels', 'sunday', 'changes', 'would', 'make', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'less', 'women', 'hear', 'roare', 'type', 'kiss', 'ass', 'women', 'show', 'little', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'dont', 'want', 'sound', 'male', 'shovanist', 'agree', 'one', 'view', 'women', 'show', 'are', 'top', 'seem', 'be', 'bruce', 'lee', 'shena', 'worrer', 'hell', 'type', 'only', 'men', 'beat', 'usally', 'have', 'powers', 'sort', 'even', 'cloe', 'who', 'got', 'little', 'dark', 'last', 'few', 'season', 'ass', 'let', 'c', 'tess', 'mercer', 'new', 'lex', 'lex', 'luther', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'came', 'up', 'women', 'villian', 'take', 'lex', 'spot', 'guess', 'fill', 'shoes', 'lex', 'was', 'judo', 'master', 'then', 'lois', 'who', 'went', 'simple', 'reporter', 'woman', 'army', 'brate', 'tought', 'special', 'forces', 'green', 'berret', 'navy', 'seals', 'kick', 'lot', 'ass', 'still', 'knocked', 'out', 'lot', 'when', 'clark', 'show', 'stuff', 'thier', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'guess', 'modern', 'tv', 'women', 'show', 'kick', 'ass', 'low', 'middeum', 'guards', 'other', 'men', 'show', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'clark', 'still', 'cant', 'fly', 'mean', 'did', 'one', 'episode', 'begging', 'where', 'tried', 'explain', 'why', 'cant', 'ever', 'person', 'crypton', 'get', 'earth', 'are', 'birds', 'start', 'flying', 'right', 'away', 'wish', 'was', 'superman', 'movie', 'where', 'zod', 'peopl', 'come', 'earth', 'dont', 'know', 'powers', 'yet', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'clark', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'crypton', 'dark', 'abilites', 'hell', 'even', 'mrs', 'kent', 'got', 'kick', 'ass', 'went', 'small', 'town', 'wife', 'gun', 'packing', 'secret', 'agent', 'dont', 'know', 'whats', 'shows', 'futher', 'season', '10', 'tess', 'wimped', 'out', 'not', 'super', 'bitch', 'was', 'shes', 'more', 'wimpy', 'bitch', 'now', 'maybe', 'zod', 'may', 'be', 'new', 'villian', 'powers', 'tess', 'be', 'leaving', 'show', 'cloe', 'clark', 'are', 'two', 'original', 'still', 'left', 'show', 'hope', 'just', 'want', 'c', 'real', 'women', 'show', 'not', '2010', 'women', 'networks', 'are', 'putting', 'place', 'man', 'kicking', 'abilities', 'bitchy', 'attitude', 'now', 'then', 'just', 'can', 'time', 'clark', 'fly', 'miss', 'cryptonight', 'humans', 'clark', 'use', 'fight', 'havent', 'seen', 'while', 'whole', 'army', 'super', 'humans', 'lex', 'use', 'collet', 'when', 'where', 'mean', 'had', 'few', 'show', 'up', 'season', '8', 'thats', 'rest', 'anyway', ""'ll"", 'continue', 'watch', 'show', 'be', 'fan', 'maybe', 'suppose', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'supernatural', 'smallville', 'will', 'return', 'top', 'list', 'show', 'watch', 'week']",N/A

I truly enjoy seeing the other DC hero cameos that are played on the series which make this very enjoyable as well from Green Arrow to The Martian Manhunter,  also for myself that made this season enjoyable was the lack of the whinny Lana Lane who with this show I couldn't really give a damn for.  Don't get me wrong Lana Lane in the comic series was o.k. but this version from the beginning made her seem very shallow for most of the seven seasons she was on,  they made her seem to have more depth but when you saw her playing with the feelings of Clark and Lex Luthor in a few seasons she just seemed to try and wait to see who could take care of her better not really seeming to care about other peoples feelings at all.  The series also is a nice intro of the more romantic development between Lois Lane and Clark that we saw coming out in season five,  and of course the situations Clark finds he has to deal with throughout the season.  A little sadly the tenth season that's coming out is going to be the last as told by the producers which makes since as you don't want to run a show to long where it becomes repetitive and looses entertainment for the fans.

In order to focus on his training and protect the citizens of Metropolis, Clark Kent (Tom Welling) has distanced himself from those he cares most, but all things change when Lois Lane (Erica Durance) returns from the future with no memories of where she's been for the past weeks. Her return is not the only big surprise for Clark as the villainous Zod (Callum Blue) and a legion of loyal followers have been released from a mysterious black orb and attempt to gain their true kryptonian powers. Despite Clark's best efforts to help the visitors and prevent the destruction of Earth, Zod's true nature comes clear and lures Lois into his schemes. Clark will also cross paths with the enchanting Zatanna, the troublesome Wonder Twins and the legendary Justice Society of America.

1273352,A1L37A25H9YOEE,B002JVWRDQ,Ryan,"[10, 15]","Everyone who's seen this season dislikes something about it. And, just like any season of Smallville, there are plenty of things to dislike. Plotholes, filler episodes, etc. However, the show's ninth season shines for what it gets right.Finally, we see Tom Welling wearing the S. That's worth a thousand points right there. Sure, the man-in-black look might seem strange at first (The Batman comparisons have been overdone). However, when you look at the end of season eight, it really does make sense. The last time we saw Clark, he had just left Jimmy's funeral. Mourning (and, therefore, dressed in black) he announced that his human identity was finished. Naturally, when we see him at the start of season nine, he has jumped headfirst into his Kryptonian identity, sporting the S shield while retaining the black clothes. You can say he's mourning the ""death"" of Clark Kent. You can say he's mourning Jimmy. You can say whatever you want. But no mater what you say, you can't deny that any outfit with the S emblem is a step above the red-and-blue ensemble we've been overexposed to since the beginning.Clark's character is really the strongest part of this season. He doesn't take the backseat as much as he did in the earlier seasons (namely seven). We finally see him standing up for his beliefs and sticking to them. He comes to some very Superman-ly decisions; he thinks things through. Most importantly, he makes me believe that he could be a superhero by the end of next year. Let's hope the writers don't mess that up.Another strong point of the season is the Lois and Clark relationship. Sure, it has its missteps. There are a few scenes where the chemistry seems off. This is probably due to poor directing. In the majority of the scenes, however, Tom Welling and Erica Durance go together like... well, Lois and Clark. It's fun to watch, and it reminds us viewers of their impending destiny.Zod is a wonderful villain played marvelously by Callum Blue. His story is told too slowly or too quickly at times. However, his performances are consistently great to watch. I only wish he could have interacted with the main cast more often. Instead, we get scene after scene with him and Tess. Initially, this is fun. Eventually, however, their relationship is confusing and (to be honest) boring. What does he want? What does she want? Who knows?In fact, that's the biggest problem of season nine: determining the characters' motivations. Tess in particular is nearly impossible to figure out. One day, she's helping Clark save the world. The next day, she's helping Zod. The day after that... your guess is as good as mine. Chloe is in a similar rut, as well. I've consistently liked her character until this season. Gone is the fun, eager-to-help Chloe. She has been replaced with a rather abrasive, confusing character who I cannot identify with whatsoever. Sure, the death of her husband could be to blame for this. But Jimmy is literally mentioned a couple of times throughout the entire season. In my opinion, Clark seems to mourn for Jimmy's death more than anyone; Chloe gets three new love interests this season, if you really think about it. Only one of them amounts to anything past an episode or so, but still... It's pretty unsettling to think that the Chloe I have enjoyed viewing for so many years has become so shallow and fickle. The writers definitely lose some points on that one.Oliver, as usual, takes up way too much screen time for my liking and only serves to weigh the story down. It is enjoyable, at times, to watch him talk things out with Clark. More often than not, however, he seems to slow down the show's pace and I find myself wishing he would just go away for awhile. No offense to Justin Hartley. He's a great actor and I really do like Oliver as a character. I just think it's time for Clark to be the definitive star of the show.That's the problem I had with this year's big promotion episode: Absolute Justice. Technically, it's two episodes. Some will even claim that it's a movie, but it's really not. If you take Absolute Justice out of context, it makes absolutely no sense to any viewers unfamiliar with Smallville. In fact, it makes little sense to followers of the show. It's eighty-something minutes of information about characters that, in my opinion, aren't that interesting. Does Smallville really need Hawkman and Stargirl? Come on.Aside from these hiccups, season nine is a vast improvement over season eight. The majority of its episodes are a blast to watch, and it's wonderful to watch Clark move closer and closer to his destiny. The music this year has been top-notch, just like the special effects and (most of) the acting. The producers really brought a darker tone to the show this year, and I think it's been great for Smallville. Not to mention that the plotholes are nowhere near as numerous as the loose ends tied. This season, we learn why Clark can't fly yet. We see Martha Kent again. We see Perry White return the favor he's been owing to Clark for seasons. And... (spoiler ahead) we get some teases as to Lex's whereabouts.Bottom line, check out season nine. If you've watched Smallville this long, you owe it to yourself anyway.",4,A Definite Step in the Right Direction,1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,5207,"['Everyone', 'who', 'seen', 'season', 'something',

I watch Bones series all the time which have much more graphic scenes but this one just blew me away. Maybe cuz he's alive with the contraption replacing his heart.  I somehow feel his pain....Anyway...a great epi but painful.  I also loved Clark's growing awareness of his feelings for Lois.  They way he stands in the shadows as the Blur wanting to reveal his secret to her but holding back is painfully wonderful to watch.  This epi actually breaks my heart a little bit because of Clark's loneliness...but it also makes me smile because of the final scene between Clark and Lois.  When she runs into his arms and hugs him...yup....made me smile....a lot.  A great epi...you gotta see it. There is magic in the storytelling...but the real magic is between Lois and Clark.

But Zod is obsessed with his people receiving the same powers that Clark possesses. So Zod has decided to transform Earth, without a care about what happens to all of humanity. Meanwhile, back at the Daily Planet, Lois and Clark's relationship develops. And many DC Comic heroes (the Wonder Twins, Zatanna, and the JSA) make guest appearances.As in each season of this long-running series, Clark goes through a lot of changes - most notably with his relationship with Lois. Clark, the man-who-will-become-Superman, juggles his relationship with Lois, dealing with the recent Kryptonian residents, his day job (which we rarely see him doing) and crime fighting as ""The Blur."" Zod and Tess are up to more scheming and no good. Chloe and Oliver round out the rest of season's regular cast, whose relationship gears up this season as well.This set contains all 21 episodes from this action-packed season. It's a solid show with fantastic actors. Now that Clark and Lois have paired up, it's high time that Clark trade in the drab black outfit and start donning his primary colors. So few science fiction shows last this long, but it's not hard to see why. Tom Welling is a stellar Clark Kent. And each season continues to improve on the last.

I remember what the producers want in this show with no flight and no tights.  The entire show was about Clark Kent becoming Superman.  The way they start show, is puberty of super powers and a boy becoming a man.  When you watch this show, it reminds me of a boy becomes a man, like a bar mitzah.  All of Clark Kent's powers came one by one, season one, he had the strength, the speed and the x-ray. The second season he had the heat ray, learned he was from Kyrpton, his birth name Kal-El and his father's name Jor-El.  The third season, he's discovered super hearing and leaping from tall buildings a single bound and found out his birth mother is Lara and how he got to earth and what happened to his planet.  The fourth season and he became an adult.  The fifth season, he found the fortress of solitude to start his training and begun college and lose his father in this season and how he has to learn to do things on his own.  The sixth season he had developed the super breath and joined a new league called the justice league with future superheroes.  The seventh season he also met his cousin from Kyrpton Kara and found out more about Krypton.  The eight season started, when Clark Kent started as a rookie journalist in the daily planet and starts becoming not yet a superman as the red-blue blur.  The ninth season Clark Kent, started some of his training in the fortress, trying to fly and lead the justice league and also resruct the justice society of america.  His mother sent the Superman suit to Clark, that's he was destined to wear and designed from Alec's picture that he drew from the episode Warrior.  His last season, ready to fly and wear the tights and start the beginning of becoming the greatest super hero of the world Superman and change the name blur to Superman. This is the last season.  For the entire series Clark Kent came from being the nerdy farm boy from Smallville to Mild Manner Reporter for the Greatest News Paper the Daily Planet and the world's greatest superhero Superman.  Superman will lead this generation as hawkman once led ours, that's what the entire series was where the man who will become Superman and lead these people into a better world and peace.

1273363,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B002JVWRDQ,Tim Janson,"[0, 1]","Season Nine of Smallville continued to expand its universe and mythology with its most ambitious season yet.  This season introduced ""Major Zod"" (Callum Blue) as he and the rest of the Kandorian survivors are freed by Tess Mercer, but without their Kryptonian powers.  The season also featured appearances by Metallo (Brian Austin Green), the Wonder Twins, The Silver Banshee, Checkmate, The Suicide Squad, Maxwell Lord and Amanda Waller (Pam Grier), and, in a two-part episode, The Justice Society of America!The Zod/Kandorian was the main storyline throughout the year as Zod sought to gain his powers while trying first to ally with Clark, then using duplicity and coercion on Lois and the other Kandorians to convince them that Clark is their enemy.  Clark and Lois have seen visions of the future with the world under Zod's control and intend to use the Book of Rao to send Zod and the other Kryptonians off Earth and to their own world.The Checkmate storyline was the most interesting aspect to Season Nine because it largely came out of left field.  Checkmate was introduced during the ""Absolute Justice"" episode with Amanda Waller dubbed the White Queen.  Icicle, an agent of Checkmate kills the Star Spangled Kid and Wesley Dodds, AKA The Sandman.  Clark and Chloe discover old documents in the Daily Planet archives about a group of men: Carter Hall, Kent Nelson, Jay Garrick, Alan Scott, Ted Grant, Abigail Hunkel, Wesley Dodds, and Al Pratt who seemed to have been framed for crimes they didn't commit.  The men were released and disappeared but are now being hunted down and killed by Checkmate.Clark eventually finds out that all of the men were members of the Justice Society of America whose real identities were exposed causing them to go into hiding.  Clark, Green Arrow, and John Jones team with the remaining JSA members Hawkman, Doctor Fate and Star Girl to track down and stop Icicle.""Absolute Justice"" was a lot to take in...maybe too much.  While it was a wonderful episode and the highest rated of the season, introducing so many new elements, even in a two hour episode was difficult to digest.  They should have kept Checkmate a mystery, perhaps just showing the logo at the end, rather than reveal so much at once.  Still, it was great to see the JSA, even if it was only a few members.  You still got to see their artifacts like Green Lantern's power ring. The Flash's helmet, Wildcat's boxing gloves, and Mr. Terrific's weight belt.  There in the JSA's brownstone headquarters was a portrait on the wall of all the members, even HIM...The Spectre.  You have to give kudos to the writers for including a glimpse of Ma Hunkel, the original Red Tornado.  They did a fantastic job with the details that only true comic fans are going to recognize.Other episode highlights included ""Rabid"" where a Krytonian plague is released that turns people into crazed zombie-like creatures;  ""Disciple"" in which Oliver comes under attack by his old mentor; ""Warrior"" features a return appearance by Zatanna; Martha Kent and Perry White return in ""Hostage"" surprising Clark with their relationship but Martha has an even bigger surprise; and finally the season finale ""Salvation"" featuring the climactic battle with Zod.Smallville threw a lot at fans this year as it heads into its tenth and final season.  Clark is not in the costume yet but he is moving more in the direction of knowing and understanding what his responsibilities are on Earth.  There's still too much of the Lois and Clark romance which often comes off as forced and there's not a great deal of chemistry between the two no matter how hard they try.

1273369,AM1C02CE4WGPC,B002JVWRDQ,"W. Corse ""OldOneEye""","[1, 2]","Having watched this series faithfully since it began over 10 years ago, I was pleasantly surprised when they announced following Season 8 that Tom Welling had signed a contract to star and help produce Smallville for another 2 seasons.  While the eighth season had its high points such as Geoff John's excellent ""Legion"" episode, they seemed off-balance without Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) and some of the episodes were less than memorable. So while I rejoiced that the show had been given a ""new lease on life"" I wondered, ""What will they do next?""I needn't have worried: Season 9 exceeded all expectations and then some. For the first time since its early years, Smallville was breaking new ground: challenging and dramatic episodes coupled with the first major rewrite of the Superman canon since the 1940's.  Smallville was always at its best when it was pushing the envelope, challenging our assumptions about this ""strange visitor from another planet"" and what he really might be capable of, so what better way than to bring an entire Kryptonian city to Earth and force ""Kal-El"" to deal with them on his own terms?From the very beginnings of the Superman character to the classic 1978 Richard Donner film, Krypton had always been portrayed as a doomed paradise, its destruction a Greek tragedy of cosmic proportions.  In the season-9 story arc we are shown a very different story: a planet of gifted people at war with themselves, their advanced civilization threatened by overreaching pride and arrogance, teetering on the edge of annihilation. This theme had been hinted at as far back as Season 2 when the Virgil Swann character (Christopher Reeve) was first introduced to help fill in the back-story of Clark's true origins, and served as the basis for several ground-breaking episodes in Seasons 3 thru 5, including the run-up to Pa Kent's untimely death and the revelation that squeaky-clean Clark Kent really did have a dark side, and a rather nasty one at that.The younger Major Zod (Callum Blue) proved the perfect foil for our still-struggling young superhero; their battle in this season's finale is quite possibly the high point of the entire series, a well-earned payoff for the ambitious storyline that kept both tension and anticipation high, each episode building to this stunning climax. At the same time, the series paid homage to the great heroes of comics past by pairing the nascent Justice League (Clark, Chloe, Oliver, Martian Manhunter) with the ""grizzled veterans"" of their recent past, the Justice Society of America.  Another Geoff John episode which became a two-hour TV movie, this finely-crafted tribute story challenges our young ""super-friends"" to embrace the true meaning of teamwork, loyalty and sacrifice.  In particular, Michael Shanks (Stargate) as ""Hawkman"" proved a very popular and enduring character, appearing in several subsequent episodes, continuing to serve as a mentor for Clark and eventually sacrificing his own life to save Lois Lane (Erica Durance) in Season 10.The overall tone was darker throughout the Season-9 episodes than in previous seasons, and some reviewers have cited this as a drawback.  I respectfully disagree.  The kids from Smallville High have long since grown up and are facing adult problems, struggling to pull their lives together.  For me this grounded all the major characters in a more believable reality that allowed for truly dramatic episodes as opposed to the overwrought melodrama that sometimes over-powered these characters in seasons past.  Another high point was the recurring theme that everyone has both good and bad within them, as demonstrated by Zod, Oliver, and particularly John Corbin (""Metallo"", played by Brian Austin Green) when he confessed his love to Lois Lane.  Erica Durance, who will remain the definitive ""Lois"" for many years to come, gave one of her finest performances in that scene, showing great empathy and honesty when she responded simply:  ""In a different lifetime, things might have been different.""The Blu-Ray edition has some quirks that I found annoying, particularly in the episode menu-bar that is far less responsive than it should be.  Aside from that, the hi-def quality of the shows is outstanding, as is the cinematography in nearly every episode.  If you own no other season of Smallville, this is the one you must have.

1273372,AP3B615GM191G,B002JVWRDQ,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[10, 45]","When the Eighth Season of Smallville concluded, I wondered how the show could sink any lower.  The show's writers had drawn out the Doomsday plot arc all season, then blew it on an anti-climatic finale.  Unfortunately, they didn't get back on the right track until very late in Season Nine...literally, the season finale.This season continued the pattern of featuring more obscure Superman comic book characters, including Metallo, The Dark Archer, Roulette, Toyman (a return appearance), and the Justice Society (in the seasons only other passable episode).  Though I applaud the show for trying to feature more aspects of the Superman mythology in lieu of the ""freak of the week"" angle, the fact of the matter is that these character just don't resonate as much (and thus don't create as much drama) as the major villains of seasons past.  When I think of Superman baddies, the hierarchy is Lex Luthor (done), Zod (don...twice, actually), Brainiac (done), Doomsday (done), and maybe Darkseid (hinted at as the Season Ten primary enemy to Clark).  The other guys/gals, at least to me, are just fill-ins.The primary story arc of the season, though, focuses on the return of Zod (this time in body, not spirit, form) and his army of followers.  Though the acting of Callum Blue is wonderful in channeling Terrance Stamp's movie Zod interpretation, ultimately his character's angle feels overly drawn-out (including a romance with Tess Mercer that is utterly ridiculous) and doesn't produce any real drama until the very end...once the fate of his character has already been decided.Plus, it wouldn't be Smallville (broadcast on the CW network) without the nauseating love triangles that only serve to create a little hollow drama or sexual tension.  Oliver/Lois, Clark/Lois, Clark/Chloe, Oliver/Chloe, Tess/Zod, and Tess/Oliver are all covered this season, and none of them are likeable whatsoever, usually treading over already-covered ground or going in completely ridiculous, outrageous directions.In terms of acting, Tom Welling (Clark) and Allison Mack (Chloe) turn in solid efforts, but Erica Durance (Lois) is still sickening, as is Justin Hartley in portraying Oliver Queen.  Blue, as mentioned, is a joy to watch, but his primary foil--Cassidy Freeman as Tess Mercer--pales in comparison (again) to Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor.Thus, despite an incredible finale that came out of nowhere to actually whet my appetite for the 10th (and final) season, this installment in the series was another monumental disappointment.  I can only hope that the writers/producers build on ""Salvation"" and deliver a more consistent final effort that will make we WANT to tune in ever Friday night, not doing so like a chore.",1,Sterling Finale Can't Save Worst Season In Show History,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,2717,"['When', 'Eighth', 'Season', 'Smallville', 'concluded', 'wondered', 'how', 'show', 'could', 'sink', 'lower', 'show', 'writers', 'had', 'drawn', 'out', 'Doomsday', 'plot', 'season', 'then', 'blew', 'anti-climatic', 'finale', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', 'right', 'track', 'very', 'late', 'Season', 'Nine', 'literally', 'season', 'finale.This', 'season', 'continued', 'pattern', 'featuring', 'more', 'obscure', 'Superman', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'including', 'Metallo', 'Dark', 'Archer', 'Roulette', 'Toyman', 'return', 'appearance', 'Justice', 'Society', 'seasons', 'only', 'other', 'passable', 'episode', 'applaud', 'show', 'trying', 'feature', 'more', 'aspects', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'lieu', 'freak', 'week', 'angle', 'fact', 'matter', 'character', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'much', 'thus', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'much', 'drama', 'major', 'villains', 'seasons', 'past', 'When', 'think', 'Superman', 'baddies', 'hierarchy', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'done', 'Zod', 'don', 'twice', 'actually', 'Brainiac', 'done', 'Doomsday', 'done', 'maybe', 'Darkseid', 'hinted', 'Season', 'Ten', 'primary', 'enemy', 'Clark', 'other', 'guys/gals', 'least', 'are', 'just', 'fill-ins.The', 'primary', 'story', 'arc', 'season', 'though', 'return', 'Zod', 'time', 'body', 'not', 'spirit', 'form', 'army', 'followers', 'acting', 'Callum', 'Blue', 'wonderful', 'channeling', 'Terrance', 'Stamp', 'movie', 'Zod', 'interpretation', 'ultimately', 'character', 'angle', 'feels', 'overly', 'drawn-out', 'including', 'romance', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', ""n't"", 'produce', 'real', 'drama', 'very', 'end', 'once', 'fate', 'character', 'already', 'been', 'decided.Plus', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Smallville', 'broadcast', 'CW', 'network', 'nauseating', 'love', 'only', 'serve', 'create', 'little', 'hollow', 'drama', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Oliver/Lois', 'Clark/Lois', 'Clark/Chloe', 'Oliver/Chloe', 'Tess/Zod', 'Tess/Oliver', 'are', 'covered', 'season', 'none', 'are', 'likeable', 'whatsoever', 'usually', 'treading', 'already-covered', 'ground', 'going', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'outrageous', 'directions.In', 'terms', 'acting', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Clark', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Chloe', 'turn', 'solid', 'efforts', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'Lois', 'still', 'sickening', 'Justin', 'Hartley', 'portraying', 'Oliver', 'Queen', 'Blue', 'mentioned', 'joy', 'watch', 'primary', 'foil', 'Cassidy', 'Freeman', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'pales', 'comparison', 'again', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Luthor.Thus', 'incredible', 'finale', 'came', 'nowhere', 'actually', 'whet', 'appetite', '10th', 'final', 'season', 'installment', 'series', 'was', 'monumental', 'disappointment', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'writers/producers', 'build', 'Salvation', 'deliver', 'more', 'consistent', 'final', 'effort', 'will', 'make', 'WANT', 'tune', 'ever', 'Friday', 'night', 'not', 'doing', 'so', 'chore']",N/A
1273373,AFZNJHDGE0DUJ,B002JVWRDQ,Zadius Sky,"[1, 2]","&#34;Smallville&#34; is one of my favorite shows to watch, and for 10 years, it is a show loaded with lessons and trials for one man to endure and to learn before becoming a symbol of hope for mankind. It's a show based on the well-famous comic book character, Superman, and it is a background to that man that we have come to love and look up to. Throughout the years, I would see aspects of myself in this boy as he'd go through many experiences and learning something from them, on the road to becoming a &#34;man.&#34; It is such an extraordinary series. I am also grateful for an introduction of Chloe Sullivan character to the DC Universe as she has provided such a powerful personality to Clark's inner circle.Now, the Ninth Season of &#34;Smallvile&#34; is considered to be a &#34;darkest&#34; aspect of the entire show where Clark began avoiding everyone that he ever cared about and trying to embrace his Kryptonian side (based on guilt), but he haven't fully comprehend the utmost importance of his connection with humanity. He began with &#34;There is no Clark Kent&#34; notion and became so one-sided to his personality, and he'd lose himself in that. It is obsessive, a single-minded way of dealing with things. He indeed is fooling himself. But, Lois has come back (from the future) and suddenly she isn't able to escape Clark's mind as his connection to her is so strong. In a way, she pulls him back to humanity. This season revealed another conflict within Clark and that is a struggle between being human and being Kryptonian. Zod, a clone of the real Zod, is a regular villain for this season and have an agenda for himself of being an egoistic tyrant. Also, Oliver Queen is struggling with his own personal demons and a drastic measure was taken to pull him back from the abyss. Jor-El returns in a human form, no longer a voice in the ice castle...even for a short while. A glimpse of a worse future when Zod ruled the world is revealed. A team of legendary Justice Society of America make their appearances. An introduction of a dangerous organization called &#34;Checkmate&#34; is demonstrated. And, evidently, the relationship between Clark and Lois will take its fruit.Clark's costume reflects this season as a hero who &#34;must&#34; remain in the shadows. It is black on black with a white &#34;S&#34; symbol on his chest. This could reflect a &#34;black-and-white&#34; thinking in Clark's mind and an inner conflict between human and Kryptonian sides (interesting how that reflects to the outer world: a war between the humans and the Kandorians).I felt that the Ninth season is the strongest point in the show's history before the final, and a great viewing of Clark's trials and lessons in his struggles between his two natures.After darkness comes the dawn...",5,A Spectacular Show,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,2791,"['34', 'Smallville', '34', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'watch', '10', 'years', 'show', 'loaded', 'lessons', 'trials', 'one', 'man', 'endure', 'learn', 'becoming', 'symbol', 'hope', 'mankind', 'show', 'based', 'well-famous', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'Superman', 'background', 'man', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'look', 'up', 'years', 'would', 'see', 'aspects', 'myself', 'boy', ""'d"", 'go', 'many', 'experiences', 'learning', 'something', 'road', 'becoming', '34', 'man.', '34', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'series', 'am', 'also', 'grateful', 'introduction', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'character', 'DC', 'Universe', 'provided', 'powerful', 'personality', 'Clark', 'inner', 'circle.Now', 'Ninth', 'Season', '34', 'Smallvile', '34', 'considered', 'be', '34', 'darkest', '34', 'aspect', 'entire', 'show', 'where', 'Clark', 'began', 'avoiding', 'everyone', 'ever', 'cared', 'trying', 'embrace', 'Kryptonian', 'side', 'based', 'guilt', 'have', ""n't"", 'fully', 'comprehend', 'utmost', 'importance', 'connection', 'humanity', 'began', '34', 'Clark', 'Kent', '34', 'notion', 'became', 'so', 'one-sided', 'personality', ""'d"", 'lose', 'obsessive', 'single-minded', 'way', 'dealing', 'things', 'indeed', 'fooling', 'Lois', 'come', 'back', 'future', 'suddenly', ""n't"", 'able', 'escape', 'Clark', 'mind', 'connection', 'so', 'strong', 'way', 'back', 'humanity', 'season', 'revealed', 'conflict', 'Clark', 'struggle', 'being', 'human', 'being', 'Kryptonian', 'Zod', 'clone', 'real', 'Zod', 'regular', 'villain', 'season', 'have', 'agenda', 'being', 'egoistic', 'tyrant', 'Also', 'Oliver', 'Queen', 'struggling', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'drastic', 'measure', 'was', 'taken', 'pull', 'back', 'abyss', 'Jor-El', 'returns', 'human', 'form', 'no', 'longer', 'voice', 'ice', 'castle', 'even', 'short', 'while', 'glimpse', 'worse', 'future', 'when', 'Zod', 'ruled', 'world', 'revealed', 'team', 'legendary', 'Justice', 'Society', 'America', 'make', 'appearances', 'introduction', 'dangerous', 'organization', 'called', '34', 'Checkmate', '34', 'demonstrated', 'evidently', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'will', 'take', 'fruit.Clark', 'costume', 'season', 'hero', 'who', '34', 'must', '34', 'remain', 'shadows', 'black', 'black', 'white', '34', 'S', '34', 'symbol', 'chest', 'could', 'reflect', '34', 'black-and-white', '34', 'thinking', 'Clark', 'mind', 'inner', 'conflict', 'human', 'Kryptonian', 'sides', 'interesting', 'how', 'outer', 'world', 'war', 'humans', 'Kandorians', '.I', 'felt', 'Ninth', 'season', 'strongest', 'point', 'show', 'history', 'final', 'great', 'viewing', 'Clark', 'trials', 'lessons', 'struggles', 'two', 'natures.After', 'darkness', 'dawn']",N/A
