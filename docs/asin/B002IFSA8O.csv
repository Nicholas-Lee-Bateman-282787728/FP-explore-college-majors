Hillerman's decriptions are carried out well for the most part and much of the filming looks like it took place in part of the region (although there is more green and water in the film than in the books.)  Wes Studi (a Comanche I believe) is a dead ringer for Joe Leaphorm, and Adam Beach ( a Canadian Indian) plays a suburb Jim Chee.  Leaphorm in the no-nonsense connect the dots on the map investigator while Chee is a wannabe Singer in a police uniform.  Between them they solve crimes following different methods and paths that finally come together to find justice and regain order.  THIEF OF TIME is one of the better books and is a good movie about the conflicts of science -- prsuit of knowledge versus pursit of personal fame.
