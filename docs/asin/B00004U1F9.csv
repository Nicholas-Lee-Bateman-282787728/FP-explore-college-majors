551435,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B00004U1F9,Ace-of-Stars,"[34, 36]","*It is extremely rare for me to grace a film release with the coveted ''Five Star'' for a review score, but let me state for the record that dispite this scoring system's limitation to only ''five'' stars, I give Koreeda Hirokazu's ''After Life'' (Japanese title: ''Wonderful Life'') ''Nine Stars!'' It is a film that should be seen and taken to heart, despite whatever theological or eschatological beliefs the viewer may have. (This was not designed as or intended to be a religious film ... if it causes the viewer to reflect more deeply upon their particular religious ideology or to meditate on spiritual matters that's not necessarily a bad thing, but film clearly addresses something else entirely.)Inspired by experiences he witnessed in his own family life , Koreeda-san presents the viewer with an intriguing premise: After death, you are taken to a processing center (or ''Limbo,'' if you will) ... While there you are given a deadline of only three days to choose just one memory that you can take with you into eternity -- These memories are then reproduced on film and shown on screen inside a special movie theatre that also serves as the launching pad to take you to your ''final destination'' as you ''relive'' (view) your most cherished memory.The ''Limbo'' situation, as portrayed in this film, is unnervingly esoteric and confusing, and yet it offers an amazingly refreshing break from the stereotypically pristine, anticeptic, sterile, ''impersonal'' visual representations of post-life scenarios we've all been force-fed throughout history (much like the skinny effeminate visual representations of Jesus) and presents us with a setting that actually exudes a feeling of warmth, comfort, compassion, and familiarity, despite the obviously near-ramshackled and uninspiring state of this particular transfer point.Some viewers may be a little put-off by the slowness of the film's pace, but this is extremely necessary for the important character development that takes place. Granted, the film could have done better by providing us with fewer ''initiates'' going through this particular processing phase, so as to allow for even deeper character development; at the same time, however, processing such a large group of people at one time, as presented in the movie, as well as the number of ''interviewers,'' provides us with a smorgasbord of personalities and motivations which  highlights the vast differences and uniquenesses of the characters on screen and gives us added motivation to reflect on our own differences and uniquenesses, as well as how we act and interact with one other. (The final scene with Arata-san's character, ''Mochizuki,'' is especially touching.)No, the film does not answer all of the questions it poses, nor does it really try to, nor do I think it should -- it is, for all intents and purposes, an examination into the human soul, if you will, and merely intends to have its viewers reflect on the more important questions raised and to motivate us into taking a long, deep, hard look at our very short lives and reflect on our most dear and cherished moments, and to not only ask ourselves ''which one'' memory would we choose to take with us and why, but to also ask ourselves if it could even be possible for us to select just one.(For a deeper understanding of what Koreeda-san was trying to accomplish with this film, be sure to read the segment entitled ''Director's Statement'' on the DVD edition of the film.)*********************",5,"The Most Compelling Question -- ""What If...?""",1013644800,"02 14, 2002",2002,3491,"['*It', 'extremely', 'rare', 'grace', 'film', 'release', 'coveted', 'Five', 'Star', 'review', 'score', 'let', 'state', 'record', 'scoring', 'system', 'limitation', 'only', 'five', 'stars', 'give', 'Koreeda', 'Hirokazu', 'Life', 'Japanese', 'title', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Nine', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'taken', 'heart', 'theological', 'eschatological', 'viewer', 'may', 'have', 'was', 'not', 'designed', 'intended', 'be', 'religious', 'film', 'viewer', 'reflect', 'more', 'deeply', 'particular', 'religious', 'ideology', 'meditate', 'spiritual', 'matters', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'clearly', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'Inspired', 'experiences', 'witnessed', 'own', 'family', 'life', 'Koreeda-san', 'viewer', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'death', 'are', 'taken', 'processing', 'center', 'Limbo', 'will', 'are', 'given', 'deadline', 'only', 'three', 'days', 'choose', 'just', 'one', 'memory', 'can', 'take', 'eternity', 'memories', 'are', 'then', 'reproduced', 'film', 'shown', 'screen', 'special', 'movie', 'theatre', 'also', 'launching', 'pad', 'take', 'final', 'destination', 'relive', 'view', 'most', 'cherished', 'memory.The', 'Limbo', 'situation', 'portrayed', 'film', 'unnervingly', 'esoteric', 'confusing', 'yet', 'amazingly', 'refreshing', 'break', 'stereotypically', 'pristine', 'anticeptic', 'sterile', 'impersonal', 'visual', 'representations', 'post-life', 'scenarios', ""'ve"", 'been', 'force-fed', 'history', 'much', 'skinny', 'effeminate', 'visual', 'representations', 'Jesus', 'setting', 'actually', 'feeling', 'warmth', 'comfort', 'compassion', 'familiarity', 'obviously', 'near-ramshackled', 'uninspiring', 'state', 'particular', 'transfer', 'point.Some', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'put-off', 'slowness', 'film', 'pace', 'extremely', 'necessary', 'important', 'character', 'development', 'place', 'Granted', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'providing', 'fewer', 'initiates', 'going', 'particular', 'processing', 'phase', 'so', 'allow', 'even', 'deeper', 'character', 'development', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'processing', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'one', 'time', 'presented', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'interviewers', 'smorgasbord', 'personalities', 'motivations', 'highlights', 'vast', 'differences', 'uniquenesses', 'characters', 'screen', 'added', 'motivation', 'reflect', 'own', 'differences', 'uniquenesses', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'act', 'interact', 'one', 'other', 'final', 'scene', 'Arata-san', 'character', 'Mochizuki', 'especially', 'touching', 'No', 'film', 'not', 'answer', 'questions', 'really', 'try', 'do', 'think', 'should', 'intents', 'purposes', 'examination', 'human', 'soul', 'will', 'merely', 'have', 'viewers', 'reflect', 'more', 'important', 'questions', 'raised', 'motivate', 'taking', 'long', 'deep', 'hard', 'look', 'very', 'short', 'lives', 'reflect', 'most', 'dear', 'cherished', 'moments', 'not', 'only', 'ask', 'one', 'memory', 'would', 'choose', 'take', 'why', 'also', 'ask', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'possible', 'select', 'just', 'one', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'what', 'Koreeda-san', 'was', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'read', 'segment', 'entitled', 'Director', 'Statement', 'DVD', 'edition', 'film', '*********************']",After Life

It is boring and tedious to watch and the characters are uninteresting.The movie is filmed almost as a documentary, and the people portrayed are given rich histories, especially since they have to describe them to employees of the After Life who work in an abandoned office building. These recently decreased are given 3 days to remember their best memory which they will take as they either go to Heaven or Hell. The employees will recreate the memory for them.We are introduced to up to 22 characters, and 4 or so employees. They are all serene and have different issues and they talk a lot. I'm surprise that the employees didn't fall over asleep listening to the memories of these boring people. It definitely doesn't help that all these people talk in monotone.The problem with this movie is that beyond it's interesting premise, we have nothing of interest here. The movie is broken up by days and basically we have people talking. The problem is that if this were a real documentary, this could have been interesting, but I was always aware that they are actors and they are basically reading off their lines. Their stories have no substance because we only get to hear them, not experience them.This is an incomplete review because I could not watch the rest of the DVD (I fast forwarded it). The performances were too contrived, the director obviously didn't have the budget to show the lives of these people and the whole picture is like being forced to read a classic piece of literature which everyone says is really great, but no one actually reads.

For me, films are all about endings, and I felt in this area After Life didn't quite pay off. I didn't really buy into the romance, and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so I could care more whether she gets the guy or not.  I also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me.

551441,A1P2KRAMSBR1RR,B00004U1F9,David Alston,"[6, 6]","There are many films referred to as 'lifelike,' as a positive attribute.  This marvelous film - ironically about a post-mortem limbo world - is one of few that actually earns the term.AFTER LIFE's contents are well-summarized by many other reviewers here, so I'd rather point out a few other notable aspects of the films, rather than rehash previous comments.Kore'eda's roots were in documentary work, and a fascination with the kinds of stories that might unfold right before our eyes is one is strongly explored here, and in his other work.  The same holds true for memory - specifically it's instability, it's idealistic qualities, and it's romantic nature.  This focus was - according to Kore'eda - actually inspired by the Alzheimers-related decline of his grandfather (a major personal influence and role-model) - and this interest was also powerfully explored in his earlier MABOROSI (grief and growing beyond grief), and DISTANCE (a real masterpiece, charting the shifts between grief, blame, redemption and forgiveness between individuals who survivied a cult terror attack).In AFTER LIFE, the same themes are allowed to slowly unfold, with a slow and recollective quality that - to me - has always been riveting.  The film is very quiet in its' nature, so it may not be for everyone, but the drift towards naturalistic revelations is handled brilliantly here, leading to surprising moments of tenderness, and of dry and unexpected humor.  This is a film in which nothing feels forced, but a gradually-coalescing story does emerge, and move along on its' own hypnotic power.There is yet another theme present here as well - the transformative magic of film as a creative medium.  The varied memories of the recently departed are commemorated in/as short films, improvisationally staged, which - under Kore'eda's guidance - is something of a love letter to film's potential as something democratic, and something that could record the spontaneous history and magic within 'ordinary' lives.Successful at many levels, all of which weave together with skill and subtlety, AFTER LIFE is one of my favorites of recent years.

This is a terrific, thought-provoking concept that is very well executed.  Director Hirokazu Kore-eda downplays the metaphysical angle by placing his characters in a very pragmatic, down-to-earth environment--an old building, harried case workers on a tight schedule, and a noticeable and commendable lack of ethereal visual or sound effects.  We are treated to many interesting interviews with clients who are trying to select a memory.  Some of these interviews are genuine and unscripted, conducted with non-actors.

551444,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B00004U1F9,Ernest Jagger,"[4, 4]","This film is not for everyone, however, I highly recommend it. This is a very interesting Japanese film, which was released in 1998. In the film, when people die they spend a week with counselors who are also deceased. The counselors help the dead to pick one memory from their lives. This one memory will be with them for eternity. I know this sounds a little silly, but I found the film to be fascinating. I know that I am a little biased towards Japanese films, however, there was something about the film that drew me in and kept my attention.The film is both humorous and compassionate. Once the deceased decide which memory they are to take with them into eternity, then ALL other memories will be forgotten. Which memory would you take? The staff of counselors who are there to help the deceased have films which help the dead decide which memory to take. When the deceased are shown the films of the memory they are to keep, then they vanish. I liked the way the film was done.Moreover, the different characters whose lives were portrayed gave a very life affirming portrayal of what each person deemed was their most important memory to take with them into eternity.

551447,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00004U1F9,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[1, 4]","Kirokazu Kore-eda spent almost a decade working for a Japanese independent TV station-where he directed several dazzling documentaries that dealt with the fringe elements in Japanese society. He enjoyed tremendous success with his first feature film, MABOROSI (1995). He directed AFTER LIFE in 1998, and it was very well received by the critics.Kore-eda has created a unique place-a way station where all souls must stop for one week-housed in a run-down abandoned complex. The souls are counseled and told that they are, in fact, dead-and that they are in transition. They are tasked to review their lives and come up with-to choose one favorite memory-but only one. It might have been an epiphany, a trauma, a pivotal moment-or merely a pleasant thing that floats to the surface. The ""staff"" would then recreate that memory on film-and the souls would gather in a theatre and view it on the seventh day. Once reviewed and connected with-then the soul would be allowed to more on-to somewhere-to something. As the souls move on they would be able to cherish that one memory-and all the other earthly memories of their past lives were supposed to be expunged.In Kore-eda's vision of the other side there is no God, or the Devil, no angels or demons-not even the mention of any particular religion. In this middle world, this stopping place-apparently there are ""many"" way stations. I would hope so. They only process a couple dozen souls a week through them-and that would most certainly not keep up with the death rate. The largest bone of contention I had with this lovely film was its central premise-the pick only one memory motif. I would like to consider that once on the other side, every memory of our past life would matter-as we view our ""Life Review"". Somehow this put my mind and my emotions in turmoil. So, I apologize, Kore-Eda San. I could not approach your vision and the sweetness of your film with an open mind or an open heart. One critic in LIBERTAS wrote,"" Kore-Eda's strength is clearly lyrical rather than philosophical.""Kore-dea appeared, with his crew, in this film-as the film crew within the staff of the way station. It helped make the transition from documentary to fiction more palatable. The director had interviewed 500 people, and then chose 13 to appear in the film. They appeared as themselves and improvised their own dialogue. He used one cinematographer for the interviews, and another to establish the mood and tone of the way station and its phantom staff. The blending of real and imagined dialogue is not always smooth-but the concept is very creative and interesting.I had heard the buzz about this film for a long time, and I was really looking forward to viewing it. Perhaps I expected too much-wanted too much-had expected it to answer some of my specific after life and spiritual questions. But instead, for me it just posed conundrums, and bent perceptions-and offered what seemed to be a silly and unworkable postulation. I do applaud the sweet sadness and insight the film exhibits-and would recommend it.",3,Purgatory as Steerage,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,3055,"['Kirokazu', 'Kore-eda', 'spent', 'almost', 'decade', 'working', 'Japanese', 'independent', 'TV', 'station-where', 'directed', 'several', 'dazzling', 'documentaries', 'dealt', 'fringe', 'elements', 'Japanese', 'society', 'enjoyed', 'tremendous', 'success', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'MABOROSI', '1995', 'directed', 'AFTER', 'LIFE', '1998', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'received', 'critics.Kore-eda', 'created', 'unique', 'place-a', 'way', 'station', 'where', 'souls', 'must', 'stop', 'one', 'week-housed', 'run-down', 'abandoned', 'complex', 'souls', 'are', 'counseled', 'told', 'are', 'fact', 'dead-and', 'are', 'transition', 'are', 'tasked', 'review', 'lives', 'come', 'up', 'with-to', 'choose', 'one', 'favorite', 'memory-but', 'only', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'epiphany', 'trauma', 'pivotal', 'moment-or', 'merely', 'pleasant', 'thing', 'surface', 'staff', 'would', 'then', 'recreate', 'memory', 'film-and', 'souls', 'would', 'gather', 'theatre', 'view', 'seventh', 'day', 'Once', 'reviewed', 'connected', 'with-then', 'soul', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'more', 'on-to', 'somewhere-to', 'something', 'souls', 'move', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'cherish', 'one', 'memory-and', 'other', 'earthly', 'memories', 'past', 'lives', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'expunged.In', 'Kore-eda', 'vision', 'other', 'side', 'God', 'Devil', 'angels', 'demons-not', 'even', 'mention', 'particular', 'religion', 'middle', 'world', 'stopping', 'place-apparently', 'are', 'many', 'way', 'stations', 'would', 'hope', 'so', 'only', 'process', 'couple', 'dozen', 'souls', 'week', 'them-and', 'would', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'death', 'rate', 'largest', 'bone', 'contention', 'had', 'lovely', 'film', 'was', 'central', 'premise-the', 'pick', 'only', 'one', 'memory', 'motif', 'would', 'like', 'consider', 'once', 'other', 'side', 'memory', 'past', 'life', 'would', 'matter-as', 'view', 'Life', 'Review', 'Somehow', 'put', 'mind', 'emotions', 'turmoil', 'So', 'apologize', 'Kore-Eda', 'San', 'could', 'not', 'approach', 'vision', 'sweetness', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'open', 'heart', 'One', 'critic', 'LIBERTAS', 'wrote', 'Kore-Eda', 'strength', 'clearly', 'lyrical', 'rather', 'philosophical', 'Kore-dea', 'appeared', 'crew', 'film-as', 'film', 'crew', 'staff', 'way', 'station', 'helped', 'make', 'transition', 'documentary', 'fiction', 'more', 'palatable', 'director', 'had', 'interviewed', '500', 'people', 'then', 'chose', '13', 'appear', 'film', 'appeared', 'improvised', 'own', 'dialogue', 'used', 'one', 'cinematographer', 'interviews', 'establish', 'mood', 'tone', 'way', 'station', 'phantom', 'staff', 'blending', 'real', 'imagined', 'dialogue', 'not', 'always', 'smooth-but', 'concept', 'very', 'creative', 'interesting.I', 'had', 'heard', 'buzz', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'viewing', 'Perhaps', 'expected', 'too', 'much-wanted', 'too', 'much-had', 'expected', 'answer', 'specific', 'life', 'spiritual', 'questions', 'instead', 'just', 'posed', 'conundrums', 'bent', 'perceptions-and', 'offered', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'silly', 'unworkable', 'postulation', 'do', 'applaud', 'sweet', 'sadness', 'insight', 'film', 'exhibits-and', 'would', 'recommend']",After Life

Most say that the single most important lesson they learned is that the actions we think are trivial and unimportant turn out to be the most important, especially ones that involve spontaneous acts of love.In After Life, by Hirokazu Koreeda, a group of recently deceased people are asked to look back at their life and choose only one memory that they want to take with them to eternity. The process compels people to look at their life in its entirety and see what worked and what was missing. In what looks like a dreary barracks-like way station, civil servants meet with those just crossed over to help them choose the experience they want to hold on to. For some, the choice is easy, for others it is quite difficult. Those that will not or cannot choose are consigned to work in the substation with the newly deceased until they are ready to move on. The counselors work one-on-one with each individual, telling them that they have three days to make their choice. Once a memory is selected, a film crew recreates the memory -- sets are built and the little touches of sights and sounds are selected until the deceased are satisfied that they are witnessing a perfect recreation of their experience. It is that film that they take with them, not the original memory.At first some choose things such as a trip to Disneyland, a sexual encounter, or a memorable bowl of rice, but later gravitate toward experiences that are more meaningful. The center of the film revolves around those who are unable to choose. Ichiro Watanabe (Taketoshi Naito) is a 70-year old management consultant who has led an uneventful life and is challenged to find a memory he thinks is worth preserving for all time. To help him in this process, he is allowed to scan through piles of videotapes representing each year of his life. One young man wants to choose a dream instead of an actual event. Another wants to forget his past entirely, and an elderly woman is stuck in the mindset of a nine-year old girl.After Life is the story of the caseworkers as well. Takashi Mochizuki (Arata) has been stuck in limbo because he cannot find any happiness in his twenty-two years until he realizes how his short life deeply affected someone else. His perfect realization also affects a co-worker Shiori (Susumu Terajima) who has fallen in love with him. After Life is a beautiful and touching film that allows us to reflect on the things that brought us joy in our own life, and to recognize that true happiness lies, not in outward symbols of success, but in giving ourselves to others.",5,Happiness lies in giving to others,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,2784,"['One', 'most', 'commonly', 'reported', 'aspects', 'near-death', 'experiences', 'life', 'review', 'seeing', 're-experiencing', 'major', 'trivial', 'events', 'one', 'life', 'sometimes', 'perspective', 'other', 'people', 'involved', 'Most', 'say', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'lesson', 'learned', 'actions', 'think', 'are', 'trivial', 'unimportant', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'especially', 'ones', 'involve', 'spontaneous', 'acts', 'love.In', 'Life', 'Hirokazu', 'Koreeda', 'group', 'recently', 'deceased', 'people', 'are', 'asked', 'look', 'back', 'life', 'choose', 'only', 'one', 'memory', 'want', 'take', 'eternity', 'process', 'compels', 'people', 'look', 'life', 'entirety', 'see', 'what', 'worked', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'what', 'dreary', 'barracks-like', 'way', 'station', 'civil', 'servants', 'meet', 'just', 'crossed', 'over', 'help', 'choose', 'experience', 'want', 'hold', 'choice', 'easy', 'others', 'quite', 'difficult', 'will', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'choose', 'are', 'consigned', 'work', 'substation', 'newly', 'deceased', 'are', 'ready', 'move', 'counselors', 'work', 'one-on-one', 'individual', 'telling', 'have', 'three', 'days', 'make', 'choice', 'Once', 'memory', 'selected', 'film', 'crew', 'memory', 'sets', 'are', 'built', 'little', 'touches', 'sights', 'sounds', 'are', 'selected', 'deceased', 'are', 'satisfied', 'are', 'witnessing', 'perfect', 'recreation', 'experience', 'film', 'take', 'not', 'original', 'memory.At', 'first', 'choose', 'things', 'such', 'trip', 'Disneyland', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'memorable', 'bowl', 'rice', 'later', 'gravitate', 'experiences', 'are', 'more', 'meaningful', 'center', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'choose', 'Ichiro', 'Watanabe', 'Taketoshi', 'Naito', '70-year', 'old', 'management', 'consultant', 'who', 'led', 'uneventful', 'life', 'challenged', 'find', 'memory', 'worth', 'preserving', 'time', 'help', 'process', 'allowed', 'scan', 'piles', 'videotapes', 'representing', 'year', 'life', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'choose', 'dream', 'instead', 'actual', 'event', 'forget', 'past', 'entirely', 'elderly', 'woman', 'stuck', 'mindset', 'nine-year', 'old', 'girl.After', 'Life', 'story', 'caseworkers', 'as', 'well', 'Takashi', 'Mochizuki', 'Arata', 'been', 'stuck', 'limbo', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'happiness', 'twenty-two', 'years', 'how', 'short', 'life', 'deeply', 'affected', 'someone', 'else', 'perfect', 'realization', 'also', 'co-worker', 'Shiori', 'Susumu', 'Terajima', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'Life', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'film', 'reflect', 'things', 'brought', 'joy', 'own', 'life', 'recognize', 'true', 'happiness', 'lies', 'not', 'outward', 'symbols', 'success', 'giving', 'others']",After Life

It's a very culturally Japanese movie and makes more sense if you're already familiar with Japanese films, especially from an earlier period.  Much of the reminiscing the subjects do relates to events that happened when they were young, sometimes before World War II.  Americans would approach this whole subject somewhat differently.It appears to be a low budget film with lots of extras but the acting is very good.  Several of the characters are played by veteran Japanese performers.  They give the impression of representing a cross-section of the Japanese public.  Much of the movie is filmed in an old school building and this lends to the atmosphere.  The subtitling is well done - always important in a Japanese film.The topic is intriguing and it was presented very well with a surprising amount of insightful commentary.  The choices each person makes are very revealing in that the incidents they choose to remember often seem trivial, often just a bright moment during a particular day that made a big impression on them.  Some, on the other hand, are much deeper and more involved.Essentially, the movie is a collection of vignettes into the lives of the 22 subjects as well as the counselors, very sensitively chosen and assembled.  It's a thinking person's movie.  If you like to be thrilled with action and breathtaking visuals it's not for you.

551454,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B00004U1F9,Michael Valdivielso,"[7, 8]","The idea behind the movie seems too simple - once you die you go to a way station between Earth and Heaven.  You will stay there for a week.  The first three days you get to pick one memory you wish to live in - forever.  That memory becomes your after life.  The people at the station film it and show it to you at the end of the week.The film's greatness is in the delivery.  We follow not just the dead, who struggle with either a life rich in good memories or one bland and lacking in anything, but those who work in the way station.  The station itself seems worn, but clean, with meeting rooms, a theater and even apartments.  It reminds me slightly of the high schools you see in the Japanese movies.  Maybe that's the point?Anyway, even the people who work there struggle with themselves as they help those newly departed find one moment, one memory they can live with.  Or die with for an eternity.  What single event is worth so much that you can't let it go?  That it outweighs the rest of one's life?It is very profound, sad and joyful at the same time.  A perfect movie in all respects.

551455,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B00004U1F9,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[2, 2]","This slow-moving, meditative film from Japan invites being understood in so many different ways. This is partly because it lingers so long on each of its characters as they reflect on their lives after death that it's hard to resist mentally scanning the contents of one's own memory for a ""happiest moment"" to preserve for eternity, while at the expense of forgetting everything else.Eventually, the film seems as much about forgetting as remembering, for some characters refuse for various reasons to choose at all - which leaves them on the staff of the way-house that the newly dead pass through. Here, listening to the memories of others, they may eventually come to understand the purpose of their own lives. For the film is as much concerned with them as it is about the men and women, of all ages, who are being ""processed"" here on their way to eternity.The setting of the film, in an aging institutional structure, and the time - autumn - are evocative of a kind of limbo that is only partly realistic. Many of the characters as they ramble on about their lives try your patience, even while the minutiae of their memories can be absorbing. It doesn't help to reflect on the improbability of it all, but to surrender instead to the dream-like tranquility of this other-world, where no one openly grieves the loss of their lives and all human transactions take place in an atmosphere of civilized politeness.This is not a film for everyone. The director (a respected documentary filmmaker) has said that his inspiration for the film was his own memories of a grandfather whose last years were a descent into what we know today as Alzheimer's. The story his film tells is about how we formulate and recall the stories of our own lives. Rather than offering escapism, it keeps turning the focus back on the viewer.

551456,AS3UXYC6G4XN8,B00004U1F9,"RootlessAgrarian ""cine-curmudgeon""","[9, 9]","I can't add much to what other reviewers have said:  this is a fine, understated, and deeply moving film.  Where other film-makers rely on orchestral music and contrived situations as old as Western theatre to twang your heartstrings, this one uses reality:  the reality of human existence.  For that reason it twangs the ol' heartstrings louder and more musically than the most expensive Hollywood super-packaged drama.The fundamental human tragedy is that we grow old and have to leave this world, and all the memories we've accumulated, like refugees driven from our homes.  Against this tragedy, of which young people are mercifully unconscious and the middle-aged all-too-conscious, all other tragedy is played out like busy action in front of a grand unmoving backdrop.Rather than promising us a saccharine-sweet Heaven (as in 'What Dreams May Come') to paint a Disney happy-ending over the fundamental sorrow of life, this film offers us a moral and intellectual challenge -- to discover the one precious thing we would save from &quot;this burning house&quot; and take with us into an Eternity so different, so strange, that in it we will have become nothing but this one vivid memory.Few films I've ever seen have captured the poignancy of time and its passage, the emotional wealth and fragility of old age, the tragedy of life wasted, the depth of human self-deception, and the capriciousness with which meaning, like lightning, strikes in any life and illuminates some completely unexpected moment.  Plenty of writers and directors have tried.  But this film -- unpretentious, gentle, quiet, and full of a kindly, self-deprecating humour -- captures all of that and more.The only jarring note -- and it may have been introduced deliberately to preserve a realistic &quot;japanese bureaucracy&quot; feeling in the processing centre -- is that there's only one female staff member (and she's always the one serving tea, too)...  While this may irritate the feminist viewer a little, it's a minor irritation in a nearly perfect film.This is a fine film, a delight.  I confidently predict it will stand the test of time and in 20 years be considered a classic.

Hirokazu interviewed 500 individuals adolescent through senility and arranged to recreate their memory on film. These documentary pieces are interwoven with actors who create a mythical purgatory in which each decedent is given 3 days to choose among life's recollections a single scene to film, after which they disappear with their memory into the next realm. Actors portray guardian angels who help people recall the meaningful moments of their lives by deception, asking questions, manipulation, providing photos, maps, videos one for each year of life ""these videos may not match what you recall."" Recall imperfectly reflects confusion, myth, affection, and the disconnect between how we want to be seen and what really happened. Actors are interwoven with the documentary interviews.Mochizuki is a 22yo angel assigned to interview two older bland men, Yamamoto 50 who wants to obliterate his past and Watanabe 71 yo who can't recall a life memory worth preserving. The most difficult cases are the ordinary. Shiori 18yo an intern for the past year is assigned to assist Mochizuki. Her brash emotional outbursts are blamed on  ""that's what happens when you are raised without a dad."" Shiori's adolescent impatience with the bamboo quiet bursts forth with indiscreet revelations protected by colleague Kawashima ""who is Kyoko?. Their boss Kennosuke Nakamura reprimands Shiori ""the moon is beautiful, the shape never changes, it only looks different depending on the light"" hoping she understands. Boss Nakamura's competitive ego (prideful need to win) incarcerates him in purgatory.Tatara Kimiko born 1920 plays herself. The documentary filming of her defining memory of red is beyond the price of rubies.Kiyo Nishimura's dementia weaves a fascination with natural beauty as an eternal 9yo. Gisuke Shoda recounts his sexual exploits. Yusuke Iseya 21 years refuses to choose a memory. He believes not selecting a single memory consigns him to being responsible for each moment of his entire life. Kana Yoshino 16yo chooses eating pancakes in Disneyland while Shiori gently prods and pushes her to search for more meaningful memories. Nobuko Amano a professional woman discusses her affair with a married man. Is this memory or a self deceiving memory of being loved?How far back can you remember? Bundo recalls being 5 months old lying nude in the sunlight. Hot tub immersion is offered for quelling anxiety, recreating the womb.The dilemmas of the 22 individuals in this week's purgatory cohort slowly play out over 3 days allotted to retrieve and select the single memory which becomes the only accompaniment into the great beyond. After Life is a coming of age documentary-movie amalgam, intertwined with music which is believed to improve memory retention. Some with dementia are still able to sing, play musical instruments, retrieve music-associated memoryThe Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat: And Other Clinical Tales,The Music Never StoppedGrateful Dead true story,Awakenings.The entire lifespan from labor, crib, dating, marriage, midlife dreams, to maturation, aging senility is portrayed with powdered snow gentleness. And the surprise is who is assigned the role of interviewing guiding angel, and what happens to the guardians.Ikiru (The Criterion Collection)shares the same quiet unfolding storyline as After Life. The impatience of youth is contrasted with a 50 year journey interacting with other people's memories, finding bits and pieces of oneself in the process, and finally knitting the whole together into wisdom. ""Perhaps remembering is a way of taking responsibility.""Like documentaryHappyAfter Life finds meaning in the every day aromas, feel of breeze, colors, the ordinaryOur Town: A Play in Three Acts (Perennial Classics).SPOILER ALERT On re-view the first and last scenes are identical. Kawashima is assigned to interview men who regale him with their sexual exploits. Why? Iseya is assigned as Kawashima's intern. Why? The moon seen through the skylight is a movie set. On the roof, the prop master shines the shadows which play on the painted moon.Mochizuki ""I searched for a memory of happiness and learn 50 years later I was part of someone else's happiness. What a wonderful discovery.""My interpretation is the entire film is a movie set to move the stuck guardians in general, and Mochizuki in particular, toward eternity. Mochizuki was assigned Shiori as intern as a sign that he is to guide another forward before he leaves. Shiori clings to sentimentality, a crush on Mochizuki as an excuse to not choose a memory and forget him. Iseya is assigned as intern to Kawashima as a sign that Kawashima will be next targeted to move on. Kawashima shares with Shiori advice for handling men who pridefully regale with their sexual conquests during their 3 day interviews, preparing her for an assault on her fixation with insincere romantic theatricality and drama. The persons interviewed are quickly shuffled through as part of the work of the guardian angels. But the process is actually directed at moving the guardians on. Mochizuki has been in multiple facilities over his 50 years as a guardian angel. The time has come for him to discover himself.After Life has the texture of a coming of age saga, paced for immersion and contemplation. 18yo Shiori's short attention span is engaged by traffic, crowds, a mechanical clock, similar to the Rube Goldberg device in the Boston Logan airport, unwilling to engage the patience required to absorb understanding. The hopeful message is if you don't grow up on earth, you are forced to grow up After Life where pride matures into humility, dependence into responsibility, impatience into languor, reactivity into self management.5 stars hopeful movie of growing up allowing awareness to unfold with stately grace.Also seeDhamma Brothers,Healing & the Mind (Programs 1-5)and Hirokazu's heart gentlingLike Father Like Sonstory of 6 year olds switched at birth, and the decision about transferring them back to their biological families.",5,"Life is truly known only to those who suffer, lose, endure adversity and stumble from defeat to defeat.

551458,A1VGVMUOI5FHTE,B00004U1F9,"""snootchiebootchies""","[2, 6]","A deeply profound film filled with achingly-beautiful moments that ostensibly deals with memory.  No doubt the film is partly about the resilient but illusory nature of our memories, but it's also about our own reconciliation between material success and the true meanings of life.  I was particularly struck by one man's realization that the reason why he cannot come up with a happy memory is because he was oblivious of the moment when he made his mark on the world we so briefly occupy.  What he was oblivious to was somebody else's love for him, a love that, although not reciprocated, is a sign nevertheless, an indication that he was alive, that he lived a worthy life.  The film is deliberately paced, but that's not a problem because it gives the audience time to contemplate about what our happiest memories would be, what lasting marks or legacies we have left behind.  The real problem with the film, however, is that its profundities are enveloped in the clunkiest of plots, bulked up with a number of unnecessary elements (the filming of individual memories, the unrequited love of one of the staff members).  I know that to some, my complaints about the plot may seem petty compared to the sublime meaning of this film, but I found its poignancy too obscured by questions I had about the plot.  For example, why videotape?  Doesn't Limbo (or whatever this intermediate stage is) have digital technology?  What about people who died before, say, the 1970's?  Would they know what a videotape is or even know how to operate a VCR?  And I'm also certain that computer effects can do a much better job of recreating clouds than a mass of cotton balls on a wire.  Kore-eda would have been better off if the dreams had been reconstructed in a nondescript black box because its depiction of Limbo as some shabby terrestrial movie studio is just too hard to swallow.  It's difficult to transcend our misplaced worship of the material world when we are so conscious of the hard fact that we are watching a movie, a movie we paid 8 bucks to see.  At any rate, a week after seeing the film, I'm still thinking about what my one lasting memory would be.  Like the characters in the film, I initially came up with memories of important achievements filled with self-satisfaction and material rewards, but upon further contemplation, I too realize that they do not represent what my life is about.

The dead have one week to decide what one memory they will take with them into the after life. When they decide upon a memory, the memory is made into a film and the dead move on into the next life.It is touching to see what people choose from their lifetimes. It usually comes down to something simple, like riding the trolley on the last day of school. A few people have trouble deciding because of things like alzheimers or unrequited love. Others won't decide and stay in purgatory. It makes a person wonder ""What do you own?"" The answer is, of course, nothing really, just your memories.I'm in love with this movie. If you watch it and like it too, I'd recommendWings of Desire (Special Edition), andThis American Life - Season 1. This American Life may seem like a strange recommendation, but Ira Glass seems adept at choosing people's memory for them and making it into a film.

But compare the simplicity and understated elegance of writer/director Hirokazu Kore-Eda's AFTER LIFE to the gaudy, superficial, and star-studded Hollywood production DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, and you will see the difference between cinematic art and cinematic entertainment. I have watched AFTER LIFE three times and enjoyed it more each time I've seen it. Not only does it leave you thinking about your own life, it fills you with an almost Zen-like appreciation for life's unique small pleasures, the ones most easily overlooked or forgotten in the crush of everyday life.The basic story line is simple. After dying, the deceased migrate in small groups to special facilities where they have three days to choose a memory from their life that is particularly meaningful to them. They will be permitted to carry that one memory into the next life. The staff at each facility assists them in choosing and prepares a short film that replicates each person's special event to strengthen the memory just before they pass to the other side. AFTER LIFE presents one week's group at one facility, ranging from a teenage girl who wants to choose Disneyland to an old man who can't seem to choose anything. Mixed into this group are several elderly women, a rebellious young man who refuses to choose, and an older man who insists from the beginning that his choice will involve having sex.Kore-Eda uses a pseudo-documentary style, complete with unsteady camera movements and obvious jump cuts in the personal interviews. The background is anything but celestial, looking more like an abandoned prep school dormitory or army barracks, complete with bare walls, peeling paint, and the most Spartan of furniture. Seasons change, flowers bloom, snow falls, the moon rises, and cars even pass by this not-very-ethereal place, as if the location of this limbo was just an out-of-the-way corner of a big city that no one happened to notice any more. The choice is masterful, allowing us to focus entirely on the deceased group and the consultants who assist them (all of whom have never been able to choose their memory and have thus stayed behind).Of all possible weeks, Kore-Eda presents this group for its special relationship to Michizuki, one of the staff consultants. Although he appears to be just 22 or 23, Michizuki died 53 years earlier, shot in the Philippines during World War II. Although he is the object of another consultant's affections, the young Shiori (a Japanese Meg Tilly look-alike), Michizuki discovers that he has a romantic connection through one of the people in that week's group to a woman who died several years earlier. When he learns the nature of the deceased woman's feelings for him from the memory she chose to take to her afterlife, Michizuki finally finds the reason and the courage to select his cherished memory and move on to his next life.AFTER LIFE is a wonderfully uplifting story, filled with likable characters who are remarkable for seeming so average. Despite the subtitling, this is a movie you can hardly help but fall in love with. Kore-Eda's message, and the self-reflection he evokes, is as powerful as any Sunday sermon you're likely to hear. Of course, you'll inevitably find yourself trying to answer the movie's central question - what single memory of your life would you take with you to whatever comes next?",5,A Beautifully Understated and Thought Provoking Film,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,3495,"['idea', 'moving', 'transition', 'life', 'next', 'not', 'new', 'one', 'plenty', 'room', 'imaginative', 'storytelling', 'compare', 'simplicity', 'understated', 'elegance', 'writer/director', 'Hirokazu', 'Kore-Eda', 'AFTER', 'LIFE', 'gaudy', 'superficial', 'star-studded', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'DEFENDING', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'will', 'see', 'difference', 'cinematic', 'art', 'cinematic', 'entertainment', 'have', 'watched', 'AFTER', 'LIFE', 'three', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Not', 'only', 'leave', 'thinking', 'own', 'life', 'almost', 'Zen-like', 'appreciation', 'life', 'unique', 'small', 'pleasures', 'ones', 'most', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'forgotten', 'crush', 'everyday', 'life.The', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'simple', 'dying', 'deceased', 'migrate', 'small', 'groups', 'special', 'facilities', 'where', 'have', 'three', 'days', 'choose', 'memory', 'life', 'particularly', 'meaningful', 'will', 'be', 'permitted', 'carry', 'one', 'memory', 'next', 'life', 'staff', 'facility', 'choosing', 'short', 'film', 'person', 'special', 'event', 'strengthen', 'memory', 'just', 'pass', 'other', 'side', 'AFTER', 'LIFE', 'one', 'week', 'group', 'one', 'facility', 'ranging', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'choose', 'Disneyland', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'choose', 'anything', 'Mixed', 'group', 'are', 'several', 'elderly', 'women', 'rebellious', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'choose', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'beginning', 'choice', 'will', 'involve', 'having', 'sex.Kore-Eda', 'uses', 'pseudo-documentary', 'style', 'complete', 'unsteady', 'camera', 'movements', 'obvious', 'jump', 'cuts', 'personal', 'interviews', 'background', 'anything', 'celestial', 'looking', 'more', 'abandoned', 'prep', 'school', 'dormitory', 'army', 'barracks', 'complete', 'bare', 'walls', 'peeling', 'paint', 'most', 'Spartan', 'furniture', 'Seasons', 'change', 'flowers', 'bloom', 'snow', 'moon', 'cars', 'even', 'pass', 'not-very-ethereal', 'place', 'location', 'limbo', 'was', 'just', 'out-of-the-way', 'corner', 'big', 'city', 'one', 'happened', 'notice', 'more', 'choice', 'masterful', 'allowing', 'focus', 'entirely', 'deceased', 'group', 'consultants', 'who', 'assist', 'whom', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'choose', 'memory', 'have', 'thus', 'stayed', '.Of', 'possible', 'weeks', 'Kore-Eda', 'group', 'special', 'relationship', 'Michizuki', 'one', 'staff', 'consultants', 'be', 'just', '22', '23', 'Michizuki', 'died', '53', 'years', 'earlier', 'shot', 'Philippines', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'object', 'consultant', 'affections', 'young', 'Shiori', 'Japanese', 'Meg', 'Tilly', 'look-alike', 'Michizuki', 'romantic', 'connection', 'one', 'people', 'week', 'group', 'woman', 'who', 'died', 'several', 'years', 'earlier', 'When', 'nature', 'deceased', 'woman', 'feelings', 'memory', 'chose', 'take', 'afterlife', 'Michizuki', 'finally', 'reason', 'courage', 'select', 'cherished', 'memory', 'move', 'next', 'life.AFTER', 'LIFE', 'wonderfully', 'uplifting', 'story', 'filled', 'likable', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'remarkable', 'seeming', 'so', 'average', 'subtitling', 'movie', 'can', 'hardly', 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'Kore-Eda', 'message', 'self-reflection', 'as', 'powerful', 'Sunday', 'sermon', ""'re"", 'likely', 'hear', 'course', ""'ll"", 'inevitably', 'find', 'trying', 'answer', 'movie', 'central', 'question', 'what', 'single', 'memory', 'life', 'would', 'take', 'whatever', 'next']",After Life

Even more damaging, if a person's memory was wiped clean of everything except their chosen moment, the moment itself wouldn't be worth reliving once let alone an infinite number of times with no memory of what led up to that point.

Specifically, when people die, they are sent to a weigh-station of sorts, where an assigned caseworker helps them pick one memory.  That moment will stay with them forever while they forget everything else about their lives.  Each week, a new batch of the recently deceased arrives, and the staff helps them pick the moment and then recreates and films it.  ""After Life"" depicts one week in this `office' and the complications that arise as the new arrivals slowly learn about themselves.From the basic description, ""After Life"" sounds like fantasy, but the movie doesn't necessarily fit into that category.  Indeed, I was expecting the movie to be ethereal in look and tone, but it actually has a much more realistic feel to it.  This choice really helps ground the film and makes it more immediate and affecting.  We connect with the characters and feel ebullient when their moments start coming together.
