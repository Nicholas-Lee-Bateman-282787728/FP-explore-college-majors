1347160,AGEIT17HENDIS,B003J216KE,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 4]","No question after running through a seemingly endless run of crime noir films that not all the films in the genre are equal. The classics like The Big Sleep, Maltese Falcon, Gilda, and Out Of The Past speak for themselves with fine plot lines and slightly awry femme fatales to brighten things up. The film under review, although not in that category, could have been better had it not gotten caught up in some melodramatic flim-flam and stayed the hard-boiled, gritty classic grifter story that it set out to be. The outlines of the plot surely gave more promise that was delivered.Down in those post-World War II means streets out West a lot of war-weary, war-tousled, war-scarred guys tried to do, well, the best they could. And the best they could usually was some grifter scheme to make a score off some bozo mark and hit the road, hit the road fast, and leave no forwarding address. That is the substance of the plot here. Ex-soldier (World War II just in case you might have forgotten, or were not sure what war I was talking about since there are many to choose from these days) Dan Healy (played in an understated, post-war alienated, existential man kind of way by Charleston Heston before he became Moses or Ben Hur or whatever big screen techno-color champ he became later) make his downwardly mobile way to grifter-dom in some seedy skid row town.Dan's thing is gambling and, of course, for such an endeavor you need suckers with dough, easily parted with dough. And, as well, some confederates in on the scam. That is the case here as Dan and two fellow grifters (one played by Jack Webb before he got ""religion"" and became Sergeant Friday on the 1950s television show, Dragnet) rope in the sucker, a guy holding a five thousand dollar check (serious money, serious money down on mean street then) although the money is not actually his. Needless to say a fool and his dough are soon parted.And that is where things start to go wrong with this film (as well as in the lives of our three gamblers). Filled with remorse the mark (played by Don DeFore) can't face the horror of going back and confessing to his employers that he blew the dough on gambling, and instead hanged himself in his lonely room. Not for him the easy road of blowing town and changing his name, toughing it out, or even filing a court claim against the miscreant gamblers. In short, nobody, nobody this side of Hollywood takes the rope on the facts presented here. And then it gets worst. See the mark has an older dominating brother who watches out for him. Now this suicide business once he finds out the cause gets him a little exercised. See the brother is a stone-cold psycho and he is out to even the score-three dead, very dead gamblers.Well, if you have been paying attention you know that Charleston Heston, the star and therefore kill-proof, is one of those marked for extinction so the other two get their just desserts and old Heston squeaks by after some close moments. The problem is when we see finally see who the killer-brother is there is no way that anyone could believe, or at least I could believe, that this gorilla was anybody's brother. Come on.The other place where the film goes wrong is on the inevitable love interest angle. Now Danny boy, who spends a good part of the film moodily cutting up old torches from back in the day, has a sort of girlfriend. A very fetching smoky-voiced chanteuse, Fran, (played by Lizabeth Scott) girlfriend who wears her heart on her sleeve for him, although he is mostly indifferent to her. No femme fatale here-just a what you see is what you get gal who can sing the blues, while having them over her man who done her wrong. The problem is that the chemistry between Danny and Fran is all wrong, all wrong alls ways. Fran is the girl next door and Danny, is well Danny, a grifter and the two don't mix. And the plot gets further muddied when Dan, trying to get a lead of where the mark's brother is, starts to play footsie with the dead mark's non-grieving widow. So you see now what I mean when I say that not all crime noirs are created equal.",3,Grifter's Farewell,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,4092,"['question', 'running', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'run', 'crime', 'noir', 'films', 'not', 'films', 'genre', 'are', 'equal', 'classics', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'Gilda', 'Out', 'Past', 'speak', 'fine', 'plot', 'lines', 'slightly', 'awry', 'femme', 'fatales', 'brighten', 'things', 'up', 'film', 'review', 'not', 'category', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'not', 'gotten', 'caught', 'up', 'melodramatic', 'flim-flam', 'stayed', 'hard-boiled', 'gritty', 'classic', 'grifter', 'story', 'set', 'out', 'be', 'outlines', 'plot', 'surely', 'gave', 'more', 'promise', 'was', 'delivered.Down', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'streets', 'out', 'West', 'lot', 'war-weary', 'war-tousled', 'war-scarred', 'guys', 'tried', 'do', 'well', 'best', 'could', 'best', 'could', 'usually', 'was', 'grifter', 'scheme', 'make', 'score', 'bozo', 'mark', 'hit', 'road', 'hit', 'road', 'fast', 'leave', 'forwarding', 'address', 'substance', 'plot', 'here', 'Ex-soldier', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'just', 'case', 'might', 'have', 'forgotten', 'were', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'war', 'was', 'talking', 'are', 'many', 'choose', 'days', 'Dan', 'Healy', 'played', 'understated', 'post-war', 'alienated', 'existential', 'man', 'kind', 'way', 'Charleston', 'Heston', 'became', 'Moses', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'big', 'screen', 'techno-color', 'champ', 'became', 'later', 'make', 'downwardly', 'mobile', 'way', 'grifter-dom', 'seedy', 'skid', 'row', 'town.Dan', 'thing', 'gambling', 'course', 'endeavor', 'need', 'suckers', 'dough', 'easily', 'parted', 'dough', 'as', 'well', 'confederates', 'scam', 'case', 'here', 'Dan', 'two', 'fellow', 'grifters', 'one', 'played', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'got', 'religion', 'became', 'Sergeant', 'Friday', '1950s', 'television', 'show', 'Dragnet', 'rope', 'sucker', 'guy', 'holding', 'five', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'check', 'serious', 'money', 'serious', 'money', 'down', 'mean', 'street', 'then', 'money', 'not', 'actually', 'Needless', 'say', 'fool', 'dough', 'are', 'soon', 'where', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'lives', 'three', 'gamblers', 'Filled', 'remorse', 'mark', 'played', 'Don', 'DeFore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'face', 'horror', 'going', 'back', 'confessing', 'employers', 'blew', 'dough', 'gambling', 'instead', 'hanged', 'lonely', 'room', 'Not', 'easy', 'road', 'blowing', 'town', 'changing', 'name', 'toughing', 'out', 'even', 'filing', 'court', 'claim', 'miscreant', 'gamblers', 'short', 'nobody', 'nobody', 'side', 'Hollywood', 'rope', 'facts', 'presented', 'here', 'then', 'worst', 'See', 'mark', 'older', 'dominating', 'brother', 'who', 'out', 'Now', 'suicide', 'business', 'once', 'out', 'cause', 'little', 'exercised', 'See', 'brother', 'stone-cold', 'psycho', 'even', 'score-three', 'dead', 'very', 'dead', 'gamblers.Well', 'have', 'been', 'paying', 'attention', 'know', 'Charleston', 'Heston', 'star', 'therefore', 'kill-proof', 'one', 'marked', 'extinction', 'so', 'other', 'two', 'get', 'just', 'desserts', 'old', 'Heston', 'squeaks', 'close', 'moments', 'problem', 'when', 'see', 'finally', 'see', 'who', 'killer-brother', 'way', 'anyone', 'could', 'believe', 'least', 'could', 'believe', 'gorilla', 'was', 'anybody', 'brother', 'Come', 'other', 'place', 'where', 'film', 'wrong', 'inevitable', 'love', 'interest', 'angle', 'Now', 'Danny', 'boy', 'who', 'good', 'part', 'film', 'moodily', 'cutting', 'up', 'old', 'torches', 'back', 'day', 'sort', 'girlfriend', 'very', 'fetching', 'smoky-voiced', 'chanteuse', 'Fran', 'played', 'Lizabeth', 'Scott', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'mostly', 'indifferent', 'femme', 'fatale', 'here-just', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'gal', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'blues', 'having', 'man', 'who', 'done', 'wrong', 'problem', 'chemistry', 'Danny', 'Fran', 'wrong', 'wrong', 'alls', 'ways', 'Fran', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Danny', 'well', 'Danny', 'grifter', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'plot', 'further', 'muddied', 'when', 'Dan', 'trying', 'get', 'lead', 'where', 'mark', 'brother', 'play', 'footsie', 'dead', 'mark', 'non-grieving', 'widow', 'see', 'now', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'not', 'crime', 'noirs', 'are', 'created', 'equal']",N/A

1347163,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B003J216KE,calvinnme,"[2, 2]","... as this film that starts out rather slow becomes a Hitchcock-like game of cat and mouse across the country involving a psychopath bent on vengeance against a group of crooked gamblers that drove his brother to suicide after he lost money that belonged to his company in a card game. The psychopathic brother is hunting the gamblers down one by one and hanging them - which is the way his brother killed himself. Up to the end all you see of this guy is a big beefy hand with a large black ring on one finger. The gamblers that know they're targets don't even know that much about the appearance of the man out to get them. And this is their one hope - to find out what the guy looks like so they can at least have a chance.At first Charlton Heston may seem out of place here as a gray character at the center of a film noir, but he carries the role admirably. Dean Jagger is the police captain that introduces himself as head of vice but for some reason gets involved in first the suicide of the guy the gamblers took, and then in the murder cases of the gamblers. It's very strange though that he keeps dragging Heston's character downtown just to tell him he's doomed to die at the violent hands of the rampaging murderer - and then seems to do nothing about it other than to taunt him. You'll see several actors playing against their normal type here including Jack Webb as one of the gamblers that is at first a bully full of bravado turned to quivering coward as the killer closes in, and Harry Morgan as an ex-soldier turned simple by something that happened in WWII that is never explained.Only one thing is a bit annoying in this film - for some reason the makers of this film seem to think Lizabeth Scott's nightclub singing is some kind of treat for the audience. I found it distracting and found myself groaning every time she'd show up for another number.Another thing that's very interesting - five years after WWII ends much of the problems of the characters is laid at the feet of the destruction and upheaval of that war citing problems that must have been common in American society at that time - hastily made wartime marriages that went lukewarm after the war, men who went soft in the head as a result of being soldiers, men who went hard as a result of being soldiers.

Heston is on screen for virtually the entire film, and it is solely his presence that propels the film forward. Having read about this film for years, and not being able to see it until now, I was sorely disappointed in the film itself. Script has few surprises, and is totally formulaic as its predictable plot unfolds. Weak writing, plodding direction by William Dieterle (whose classic work includes ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"") and a group of poorly used actors, who have been better used elsewhere (Harry Morgan, Viveca Lindfors, even Jack Webb). Worst of all is Lizabeth Scott (who at 88 is still alive and living somewhere in seclusion), whose doormat of a nightclub singer, begging to be mistreated by Heston's character, is at her dullest. Ms. Scott, not a particularly versatile actress, was best when she was bad (""Easy Living,"" ""Bad for Each Other"" with Heston), but here she poorly lipsynchs several too many songs (that stop the already slow-moving plot dead in its tracks) to the voice of Trudy Stevens (who sang for Scott in other films and for Vera-Ellen in ""White Chistmas""), and reads her lines as though she were a drama school dropout. Don't look for the classic femme fatale in this movie; she simply isn't here.The three stars are only for Heston in his film debut; the film itself would only rate two.Biggest problem is poor quality of video. What should have been crisp black-and-white is pale grey, with many scenes looking washed out and flickering,  further diluting the pleasure of seeing the film.

It doesn't have a great script. Heston was 25 when this film was released; it was his first major film.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[0, 0]","Charlton Heston made his &#8220;professional&#8221; film debut in DARK CITY (1950), a tense crime drama in glorious black-and-white, directed by William Dieterle.Heston, Jack Webb and Ed Begley play gamblers who take advantage of the athletic director (Don DeFore) of a Los Angeles club, who has come east with $5000 in club funds to buy equipment.  When he loses the money in a crooked card game, he hangs himself in his hotel room.Now, Heston and his &#8220;partners&#8221; find themselves ruthlessly stalked by DeFore&#8217;s mysterious, psychopathic brother,  Sidney, and nobody knows what he looks like.  Begley is found hanged in his room, which motivates Heston and Webb to flee to Los Angeles in an effort to find the killer before he strikes again.Lizabeth Scott is cast as Heston&#8217;s loyal girl friend, a saloon singer; Viveca Lindfors is DeFore&#8217;s widow, who Heston, without revealing his part in her husband&#8217;s death,  tries to help while attempting to get information about her brother-in-law; and Dean Jagger is the cop trying to sort everything out.  Harry Morgan and Walter Sande are also in the cast, which is excellent.Although I do find DARK CITY  to be an entertaining thriller, I have a problem with the Heston role as written.  I presume that producer Hal Wallis wanted his new discovery to come off as a nice, albeit confused, guy and his back story certainly gives his character motivation for that uncertainty.  However, Heston&#8217;s character of &#8220;Danny Haley&#8221; is no dummy, so when he is &#8220;surprised&#8221; and disappointed when he discovers that the card game that resulted in DeFore&#8217;s suicide was crooked, it comes across as being a bit too nave.  It would have been much more effective if Haley had been part of the cheat, then reformed as the story progressed.Nevertheless, Heston, who would next be seen in THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, makes an effective debut.

Heston projects a strong persona as Danny Haley, an Ivy-leaguer and war hero without the status those things might imply. Danny co-owns a bookie joint with older, gruffer Barney (Ed Begley). One evening, when Danny visits his girlfriend Fran (Lizabeth Scott) in the downscale club where she sings, he meets Arthur Winant (Don DeFore), a friendly athletic director in town on business. Arthur hangs himself after losing his company's money in a poker game to Danny's weasely associate Augie (Jack Webb). Then Barney is murdered. Danny, Augie, and police Captain Garvey (Dean Jagger) suspect that someone is seeking revenge for Arthur's death, and Danny and Augie will be the next targets.Charlton Heston does a good tough guy with emotional baggage. It makes me wish he'd done more movies in the film noir mold. ""Dark City"" makes use of noir conventions, but its tone softens after an hour. And being pursued by a homicidal maniac is prosaic by film noir standards. It could be said that Danny is being pursued by his conscience, but that is even further from noir themes. Pop culture critic Carl Macek remarked that ""Dark City is a vision of the noir world without the emphasis of the noir ethos."" That about says it. It's a solid thriller that's intermittently noir. Heston is a strong presence. Lizabeth Scott gets to sing a lot but Fran is beneath her talents. Beautiful Viveca Lindfors plays a modestly-attired widow. And Jack Webb is always spot-on as a small-time creep. The print and sound on the 2010 Olive Films DVD are good.

Stallcup,"[2, 2]","I was surprised at how good this movie was, especially as I did not find that it rated mention in The Big Book of Noir, which seems to be the best general reference on the genre. First, the plot is interesting and a little different for noir--a gang of card sharks manipulates and cheats a hapless businessman (Don DeFore) who is on a buying trip for his athletic club and gets suckered into losing the club money he has brought along for the trip, causing him to kill himself out of guilt.  The gang itself is not a cohesive lot, and much of the interest of the movie comes from their interaction, especially that of Jack Webb (yes, playing a bad guy) and Charlton Heston (in his first movie role), who is a redeemable bad guy with a surprisingly respectable background (college, military, etc.). The brother of the hapless DeFore (Mike Mazurki, whom we don't see until the final scenes and who is a homocidal nut) finds out about the swindle and hunts the gamblers down one by one until only Heston is left.  Among the better and most surprising things about the movie are the dialogue, which is extremely good for the genre, and the opportunity for character interaction and development. As mentioned, the Heston-Webb interplay is top notch. So is Heston. His character quite believably comes a long way and seems ready to accept by the end of the movie that he is and  should be a better man than he had become.  Lizabeth Scott has a decent part and this is a good movie if you are a fan.  I think her singing is a bit overdone, but she plays to her strengths, a sultry and alluring woman, probably better than her milieu, who always seems to be let down by the men in her life but keeps trying, always with an idea of a better future. There are some interesting and accomplished supporting players, including Harry Morgan and Ed Begley.
