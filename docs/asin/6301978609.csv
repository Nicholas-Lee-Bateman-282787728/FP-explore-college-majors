Sure, this isn't a 'good' movie, but when considered as part of Elvis Presley's filmography, ""Stay Away Joe"" is darn near brilliant. At least you can tell Elvis is having a good time doing a very different type of role in a more contemporary style of film. And there's even several genuine laughs in the movie. As far as stereotypes and what not...big deal. This isn't great meaningful artistic symbolic cinema. This is a low-budget 1968 Elvis comedy. To take offense at anything going on in this or any other Elvis picture is just insane. Nearly all of Presley's movies were lightweight, harmless and dumb, and if you didn't realize that, then steer clear.",4,Far from Presley's worst,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,726,"['was', 'surprised', 'read', 'bad', 'reviews', 'particular', 'film', 'Sure', ""n't"", ""'good"", 'movie', 'when', 'considered', 'part', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'filmography', 'Stay', 'Away', 'Joe', 'darn', 'brilliant', 'least', 'can', 'tell', 'Elvis', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'doing', 'very', 'different', 'type', 'role', 'more', 'contemporary', 'style', 'film', 'even', 'several', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'movie', 'As', 'far', 'stereotypes', 'what', 'not', 'big', 'deal', ""n't"", 'great', 'meaningful', 'artistic', 'symbolic', 'cinema', 'low-budget', '1968', 'Elvis', 'comedy', 'take', 'offense', 'anything', 'going', 'other', 'Elvis', 'picture', 'just', 'insane', 'Nearly', 'Presley', 'movies', 'were', 'lightweight', 'harmless', 'dumb', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'then', 'steer', 'clear']",N/A

Now and then there is a scenic view of the beautiful country around Sedona, Arizona, but you would be better off looking at a National Geographic magazine of the same.  To call this movie ""slapstick"" is an insult to the Keystone Kops and Laurel and Hardy.  Do not be fooled by the supporting cast of formerly good actors.  They must have been desperate for a movie role to have accepted these roles.  This must be an example of why Elvis became sick and tired of making cheesy movies and went back to performing on stage.
