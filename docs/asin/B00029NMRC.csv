828603,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00029NMRC,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[1, 1]","The original cast return for an unecessary sequel of the much funnier original nine yards movie, and work hard to lift this picture above forgettable. Bruce Willis is now an apron sporting homemaker getting in touch with his feminine side and hiding in Mexico with his new hitman wife Jill (Amanda Peet). Oz (Perry) is living the high life in LA with his new wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) still in dentistry but with a small arms factory in his lavish home. All appears well until Lazlo Gogalak (Pollack) emerges from prison and comes after them for murdering his son (also played by Pollack) in the first movie. What was a reasonable idea suffers badly from ""Sequelitis"" and comes across as little more than reworking old ideas. There are some funny moments, and the 98 minute run time moves quickly enough, without requiring to much concentration, but this picture is quickly forgotten. Everything seems to be overdone to try and squeeze cheap laughs, from Pollacks poor command of English, to Willis's apparent erectile dysfunction, and Perrys paranoia and confusion. All obviously ends well for our loving quartet, but the lack of any real surprises, and a very weak script don't help the end result. OK movie, but nowhere near as good as the first, and rent before buying is a must. The DVD also has non existent extras (unless you include one trailer and director commentary) adding to the whole feel that this package was a money driven exploit flick devoid of depth or intelligence.",3,Tepid Sequel,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,1494,"['original', 'cast', 'return', 'unecessary', 'sequel', 'much', 'funnier', 'original', 'nine', 'yards', 'movie', 'work', 'hard', 'lift', 'picture', 'forgettable', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'now', 'apron', 'sporting', 'homemaker', 'getting', 'touch', 'feminine', 'side', 'hiding', 'Mexico', 'new', 'hitman', 'wife', 'Jill', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Oz', 'Perry', 'living', 'high', 'life', 'LA', 'new', 'wife', 'Cynthia', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'still', 'dentistry', 'small', 'arms', 'factory', 'lavish', 'home', 'well', 'Lazlo', 'Gogalak', 'Pollack', 'prison', 'murdering', 'son', 'also', 'played', 'Pollack', 'first', 'movie', 'What', 'was', 'reasonable', 'idea', 'suffers', 'badly', 'Sequelitis', 'across', 'little', 'more', 'reworking', 'old', 'ideas', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', '98', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'quickly', 'enough', 'requiring', 'much', 'concentration', 'picture', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'Everything', 'be', 'overdone', 'try', 'squeeze', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'Pollacks', 'poor', 'command', 'English', 'Willis', 'apparent', 'erectile', 'dysfunction', 'Perrys', 'paranoia', 'confusion', 'obviously', 'well', 'loving', 'quartet', 'lack', 'real', 'surprises', 'very', 'weak', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'end', 'result', 'OK', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'rent', 'buying', 'must', 'DVD', 'also', 'non', 'existent', 'extras', 'include', 'one', 'trailer', 'director', 'commentary', 'adding', 'whole', 'feel', 'package', 'was', 'money', 'driven', 'exploit', 'flick', 'devoid', 'depth', 'intelligence']",N/A

Vegan,"[6, 6]","Thanks to falsified dental records supplied by his former neighbor Nicholas Oz Oseransky, retired hitman Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski now spends his days compulsively cleaning his house and perfecting his culinary skills with his wife, Jill, a purported assassin who has yet to pull off a clean hit. Suddenly, an uninvited and unwelcome connection to their past unexpectedly shows up on Jimmy and Jill's doorstep: it's Oz, and he's begging them to help him rescue his wife from the Hungarian mob. To complicate matters even further, the men, who are out to get Oz, are led by Lazlo Gogolak, a childhood rival of Jimmy's and another notorious hitman. Oz, Jimmy and Jill will have to go the whole nine yards--and then some--to manage the mounting Mafioso mayhem.There isn't much about this film to enjoy. I was hoping it would be a lot funnier than it was, but I just didn't laugh at anything except Kevin Pollack's character who was hard to understand most of the time. I had no problem with the cast, I enjoyed all of their performances. Especially Kevin Pollack and Natasha Henstridge who really made the film at least somewhat watchable. If only Bruce Willis could have had more funny lines, or Matthew Perry been a little funnier, or if Amanda Peet...wait there's nothing wrong with her.

828606,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B00029NMRC,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 2]","I love this movie for a few reasons.  One of those reasons is that I'm a HUGE fan of the previous film 'The Whole Nine Yards' to which this serves as the sequel.  The next is the fact that Bruce Willis is one of the best of the underrated actors out there and captivates my attention with every performance he gives.  The third, and biggest reason I love this film is a little scene where Jimmy (Willis) and Oz (Perry) visit the local pub and get a little (or a lot) drunk.  The whole scene is worth the price of the rental.  I guess since it reminds me so much of myself and my friends (I'm an emotional drunk) and the whole morning after thing is so the way it would happen.  All in all the laughs are there, some are forced and the gags can be a bit cheesy.  'The Whole Nine Yards' was a far superior film, but this sequel is not without it's moments and Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry are a great comic team.  Bruce can tackle everything from action to comedy to drama and should be recognized a little more for that.  This may not end up your favorite title but it won't be your least.  The premise follows Oz and Jimmy as they try and rescue Oz's wife (Jimmy's ex) from a mob boss trying to get revenge on Jimmy.  Amanda Peet plays Jimmy's wife whose fed up with the softy Jimmy has become and is trying to be the tough contract killer that Jimmy once was.  There are subplots and a twist at the end that makes this more than a no-brainer, but the fact still remains that the film makes little sense...but it doesn't really matter.  Just sit back, relax, don't think about it and enjoy it for what it is...or at least watch the drunk scene, then pop in 'The Whole Nine Yards' and really enjoy yourself.",4,"""You fell down the stairs...""",1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,1708,"['love', 'movie', 'few', 'reasons', 'One', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'fan', 'previous', 'film', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'sequel', 'next', 'fact', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'one', 'best', 'underrated', 'actors', 'there', 'captivates', 'attention', 'performance', 'third', 'biggest', 'reason', 'love', 'film', 'little', 'scene', 'where', 'Jimmy', 'Willis', 'Oz', 'Perry', 'visit', 'local', 'pub', 'get', 'little', 'lot', 'drunk', 'whole', 'scene', 'price', 'rental', 'guess', 'so', 'much', 'myself', 'friends', ""'m"", 'emotional', 'drunk', 'whole', 'morning', 'thing', 'so', 'way', 'would', 'happen', 'laughs', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'forced', 'gags', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'sequel', 'not', 'moments', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'are', 'great', 'comic', 'team', 'Bruce', 'can', 'tackle', 'everything', 'action', 'comedy', 'drama', 'should', 'be', 'recognized', 'little', 'more', 'may', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'favorite', 'title', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'least', 'premise', 'Oz', 'Jimmy', 'try', 'rescue', 'Oz', 'wife', 'Jimmy', 'ex', 'mob', 'boss', 'trying', 'get', 'revenge', 'Jimmy', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Jimmy', 'wife', 'fed', 'up', 'softy', 'Jimmy', 'become', 'trying', 'be', 'tough', 'contract', 'killer', 'Jimmy', 'once', 'was', 'are', 'subplots', 'twist', 'end', 'more', 'no-brainer', 'fact', 'still', 'film', 'little', 'sense', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'relax', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'enjoy', 'what', 'least', 'watch', 'drunk', 'scene', 'then', 'pop', ""'The"", 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'really', 'enjoy']",N/A
828607,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B00029NMRC,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[6, 7]","'The Whole Ten Yards' continues the stories of the dentist Oz (played by Matt Perry) and his former neighbor and retired contract killer, Jimmy the Tulip Tudeski (played by Bruce Willis).  After escaping with millions of dollars in Mob money in the 'The Whole Nine Yards,' Oz has married Jimmy's ex-wife and moved to California to set up a practice.  Jimmy has moved to Mexico with Jill, Oz's former assistant, who has taken up contract killing herself.  Jimmy's former boss, Lazlo, is released from jail, and quickly sets out to find Jimmy and what happened to his son, Yanni.The Good:  two words:  Kevin Pollack.  He stole the show and was the highlight of the movie.  His character is like a father to a gang of bumbling mobsters that are constantly bickering and can't keep their hands to themselves.  His accent and tendency to mix up his idioms is hysterical.Also Good:  There are select scenes between Jimmy and Oz, and some with Jill (played by Amanda Peet) that bring back the feel of the movie where Oz is the befuddled dentist that can't believe he got caught up in this mess and Jimmy is the cool and collected hitman always one step ahead.  Those scenes are both cool and funny.The Bad:  What was with the neurosis of Jimmy's character?  The character from 'The Whole Nine Yards' was great and perfect for the part of hitman for that movie.  In this movie, Jimmy is breaking down, and the thing is, you're not sure if it is for real or not.  Plenty of the scenes could have been much better if Jimmy didn't come off as such a complete lunatic which required Willis to play him way too over the top.  Also bad:  the plot.  It was a good idea.  I liked the idea.  The execution was bad with the plot twists coming at awkward times.  The script probably could have been better.Overall, this movie exceeded my expectations because I thought the previews made it look terrible.  However, it did not live up to its predecessor (and that is taking into consideration that many sequels are not as good as the original).  I was still kind of disappointed with it.  This movie lacked the edge the first movie had.  I'd recommend it as a rental, but I'd spend your money on 'The Whole Nine Yards' for a purchase instead.",3,9 is Greater than 10,1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,2222,"[""'The"", 'Whole', 'Ten', 'Yards', 'stories', 'dentist', 'Oz', 'played', 'Matt', 'Perry', 'former', 'neighbor', 'retired', 'contract', 'killer', 'Jimmy', 'Tulip', 'Tudeski', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'escaping', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Mob', 'money', ""'The"", 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'Oz', 'married', 'Jimmy', 'ex-wife', 'moved', 'California', 'set', 'up', 'practice', 'Jimmy', 'moved', 'Mexico', 'Jill', 'Oz', 'former', 'assistant', 'who', 'taken', 'up', 'contract', 'killing', 'Jimmy', 'former', 'boss', 'Lazlo', 'released', 'jail', 'quickly', 'sets', 'out', 'find', 'Jimmy', 'what', 'happened', 'son', 'Yanni.The', 'Good', 'two', 'words', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'stole', 'show', 'was', 'highlight', 'movie', 'character', 'father', 'gang', 'bumbling', 'mobsters', 'are', 'constantly', 'bickering', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'hands', 'accent', 'tendency', 'mix', 'up', 'idioms', 'hysterical.Also', 'Good', 'are', 'select', 'scenes', 'Jimmy', 'Oz', 'Jill', 'played', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'bring', 'back', 'feel', 'movie', 'where', 'Oz', 'befuddled', 'dentist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'mess', 'Jimmy', 'cool', 'collected', 'hitman', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'scenes', 'are', 'cool', 'funny.The', 'Bad', 'What', 'was', 'neurosis', 'Jimmy', 'character', 'character', ""'The"", 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'was', 'great', 'perfect', 'part', 'hitman', 'movie', 'movie', 'Jimmy', 'breaking', 'down', 'thing', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'real', 'not', 'Plenty', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Jimmy', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'such', 'complete', 'lunatic', 'required', 'Willis', 'play', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'Also', 'bad', 'plot', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'liked', 'idea', 'execution', 'was', 'bad', 'plot', 'coming', 'awkward', 'times', 'script', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.Overall', 'movie', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'thought', 'previews', 'made', 'look', 'terrible', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'predecessor', 'taking', 'consideration', 'many', 'sequels', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'was', 'still', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'lacked', 'edge', 'first', 'movie', 'had', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'rental', ""'d"", 'spend', 'money', ""'The"", 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'purchase', 'instead']",N/A

They get blankets and camp out and picnic waiting for the train wreck. They toss the football around and eat cheese and drink wine. Finally, 5:00 approaches and they get ready... and ready... and ready... and 5:00 passes and no train wreck. Minutes pass and people are waiting in postponed anticipation. A half hour passes and people start to get annoyed. An hour passes and people start to leave.... but not all of them. A few remain for 4 hours waiting for the promised train wreck but none occurs - the only thing wrecked was their Saturday afternoon expectations.The plot was vacant and meandering. The characters (all the holdovers from ""The Whole Nine Yards"" plus Kevin Pollack playing ""Lazlo Goglak"" the father to the troublesome gangster in ""The Whole Nine Yards"" also played by Pollack) suffer immensely. In ""The Whole Nine Yards"" they were tightly written and well-developed. In this movie, they have become perverse and stunted. The characters and the actors who play them have no idea as to the character's motivation. The plot resolution is both predicitable and preposterous.At the end, the viewer is wondering why he had waited to see this movie with eager anticipation and angry at having been cheated of the adept comedy which was part of ""The Whole Nine Yards."" Those who stopped watching before the end of the movie did so because they were convinced (much like the above mentioned train watchers) that this movie would never deliver on its comedic promise. Those who lasted until the end held out hope that the movie would deliver what it promised only to be bitterly disappointed with the result.Woe to the trusting potential viewer who believes the promises made by this movie. Pity those who have come to learn that ""The Whole Ten Yards"" is as bland as it is derivative with its ruined characters and its unintelligibly pointless plot.",1,"A Proverbial ""Train Wreck""....

This being said, I went into this film with minimal expectations.Well, this movie turned out better than I had hoped.  The cast is still fun to watch and the story, aalthough a little confusing at times, is still plausable and symetric with the first movie.Matthew Perry plays 'Oz', a dentist, who recently married 'Cymthia', 'Jimmy the Tulips'(Bruce Willis) ex-wife.  Picking up where he left off in the original, Perry is hilarious in this film.  'Oz' is a very scared man after all that he had been thru in the first film; and, Perry plays this to perfection.  WHile this role for 'Oz' is different than the first; where he played a Dentist who simply had no clue what was happening around him; it still works with the plot and is a pleasant change-of-pace for the sequel.  'Oz' has decided to arm his house with guns and monitor the perimeter with cameras.  This drives his wife, 'Cynthia' mad to the point where she goes behind his back and plots an inheritance heist with her ex-husband 'Jimmy'.  NAturally, the the 'heist' involves both 'Oz' and hitwoman-wannabe, 'Jill'(Amanda Peat).The plot involves 'Yanni Gogalack's' father, threatening 'Oz' and kidnapping 'Cynthia' for information as to the whereabouts of 'Jimmy'(or Yimmy') as the 'Gogalacks' always say.  The rest of the movie is basically the unraveling of the planned 'heist'.Amanda Peat is great in this film, as is her character 'Jill'.  IN this one, they play-out the fact that she wants to be a professional hit-woman and continuously screws up potential 'jobs'.  Sh eplays the role well, albeit the fact that this is a 'cheesy' comedy.Bruce Willis is good and believable as 'Jimmy', but 'Jimmy' is pretending to be psychaotic thruoughout most of the film and it does get a little annoying after awhile.Matthew Perry makes this film, much as he did the first.  He is constantly being picked-on by 'Jimmy' and he just takes it all in stride so well.

At the end of the last movie, Oz married with Jimmy's ex-wife Cynthia (Henstrige) while Jimmy ran off with Jill (Peet), Oz's assistant who turned out to be a contract killer hired by Oz's wife to kill him.  It was diverting fun, which looked more like it was more fun to make than it was to watch.In ""Ten Yards"", Oz and Jimmy remain married but not quite happily.  Oz is a wealthy dentist in Brentwood, CA, but his home less a castle than an embattled fortress oozing with high-tech security devices and dripping with assault weapons.  Jimmy has gone the other direction - setting himself up in a Mexican hacienda, becoming an obsessive domestic god while leaving Jill to do the whacking.  Needless to say it's an arrangement that doesn't make their wives any happier, especially Jill who, skills aside, only accidentally kills her victims.Complicating things for everybody is Lazlo Gogolak - the father of Yanni Gogolak from the last movie (both being east-European gangsters played by Kevin Pollak) - who is determined to kill everybody from the last movie.The humor is scattershot.  It's clear that the guys who made this flick are as mystified to the sucess of the last movie as we are, and they've just thrown the leads together hopinng to repeat its sucess, and ramped things up a notch just to remind us that this is a sequel.  Willis seems more hair-triggeredpsychotic than the last time (and we must wonder twice as often whether Willis will kill Oz) while Oz seems even twice as clutzy as before.  Henstridge gets kidnapped early, so her scenes are fewer.  Pollack is actually more funny here than in ""nine yards"" but the script surrounds him with one-note morons that the movie has no interest in developing.  There are scenes that are supposed to be either funny or scary, and it seems that the writers were as mystified as the rest of us, hoping that Perry's adorable dopiness and Willis's homididal charm would acrry the way.

The bad part is that sadly, even though this film has a great cast, it happens to be one of those poor sequels with a great cast.This film picks up on where ""The Whole Nine Yards"" left off.  This time, Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tedeski (Willis)is living in Mexico with his wife Jill (Amanda Peet).  Jimmy and Jill are both hitmen.  In the meantime, Oz (Perry) is living in Los Angeles with his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge).  Everything is going well for Jimmy and Jill, and everything is going, well, OK for Oz..........until Cynthia is kidnapped by the Hungarian mob that appeared in the first film (note that in the first film, Jill was Oz's assistant and Cynthia was originally Jimmy's wife), leaving Oz to turn to Jimmy and Jill for help, which leads to about an hour of boredom.When I first saw ""The Whole Nine Yards"", I thought it was hilarious, and I didn't understand why professional movie critics didn't like it (although it did make a lot of money and was very popular when it first came out).  Maybe the fact that the guy who directed the first film, Jonathan Lynn, was not involved behind the scenes with this film could have something to do with it (Director Howard Deutch substituted for Lynn on this film).  Maybe it just had bad timing. After all, this film was released shortly before the hit show ""Friends"" went off the air; maybe Matthew Perry was just too worried about what would happen to him and his career after his show went off the air.  It has often been said that nervousness can often result in a bad thing; maybe that's the case for Perry and this film (and maybe Willis if you heard the thing about him and Lindsey Lohan).  As I sit here typing this I am grateful for the fact that I am not a professional movie critic, and that I just do this for fun during my spare time. The performances in this film aren't that great, and like several critics already mentioned when this film came out, Amanda Peet didn't pull off much of a performance than Willis, Perry, and the other actors in this film did, but you can tell that she was TRYING to act.  And like I already said, Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry are two of my favorite actors, but in this film, they come off as very annoying.  I wanted to slap both Willis and Perry for their annoying performances in this film the first time I saw it.Overall, if you are a die hard movie fan who always like sequels no matter what the critics and movie buffs think, then this film is for you.  Otherwise, if you are not one of those people, then just skip this film and see ""The Whole Nine Yards"" instead.",2,Pretty Bad!,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,2734,"['will', 'start', 'off', 'review', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'support', 'going', 'saying', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'bad', 'part', 'sadly', 'even', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'be', 'one', 'poor', 'sequels', 'great', 'cast.This', 'film', 'up', 'where', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'left', 'off', 'time', 'Jimmy', 'Tulip', 'Tedeski', 'Willis', 'living', 'Mexico', 'wife', 'Jill', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Jimmy', 'Jill', 'are', 'hitmen', 'meantime', 'Oz', 'Perry', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'wife', 'Cynthia', 'Natasha', 'Henstridge', 'Everything', 'going', 'well', 'Jimmy', 'Jill', 'everything', 'going', 'well', 'OK', 'Oz', '.until', 'Cynthia', 'kidnapped', 'Hungarian', 'mob', 'appeared', 'first', 'film', 'note', 'first', 'film', 'Jill', 'was', 'Oz', 'assistant', 'Cynthia', 'was', 'originally', 'Jimmy', 'wife', 'leaving', 'Oz', 'turn', 'Jimmy', 'Jill', 'help', 'hour', 'boredom.When', 'first', 'saw', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'professional', 'movie', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'did', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'guy', 'who', 'directed', 'first', 'film', 'Jonathan', 'Lynn', 'was', 'not', 'involved', 'scenes', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'Director', 'Howard', 'Deutch', 'substituted', 'Lynn', 'film', 'Maybe', 'just', 'had', 'bad', 'timing', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'shortly', 'hit', 'show', 'Friends', 'went', 'air', 'maybe', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'worried', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'career', 'show', 'went', 'air', 'often', 'been', 'said', 'nervousness', 'can', 'often', 'result', 'bad', 'thing', 'case', 'Perry', 'film', 'maybe', 'Willis', 'heard', 'thing', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'sit', 'here', 'typing', 'am', 'grateful', 'fact', 'am', 'not', 'professional', 'movie', 'critic', 'just', 'do', 'fun', 'spare', 'time', 'performances', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'several', 'critics', 'already', 'mentioned', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'much', 'performance', 'Willis', 'Perry', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'did', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'TRYING', 'act', 'already', 'said', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'actors', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'annoying', 'wanted', 'slap', 'Willis', 'Perry', 'annoying', 'performances', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'it.Overall', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'movie', 'fan', 'who', 'always', 'sequels', 'matter', 'what', 'critics', 'movie', 'buffs', 'think', 'then', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'people', 'then', 'just', 'skip', 'film', 'see', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'instead']",N/A

828633,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00029NMRC,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","'The Whole Nine Yards' was not a classic, but made with a surprisingly refreshing tone.  The story was unpredictable -- about the ex-hitman and the timid dentist, and some unique characters (including a hitwoman wannabe Amanda Peet).  Now, they made a sequel to it, but frankly, do we need it?  Or can they really do it when the original was based on the premise you can use just for one time?The results are lame, tired, even miserable comedy that is not funny at all.  Bruce Willis comes back as Jimmy the Tulip, whose life is now, again, in danger because a mafia boss Lazlo is out of jail, who is played by Kevin Pollack.  Many characters you saw in 'The Whole Nine Yards' return (not Mr. Duncan, though)  But the central story is about the new baddie Lazlo (buried in a heavy make-up) who happens to be the father of the baddie of the original, played by the same Kevin Pollack.This is the same ruse used in the sequel of 'City Slickers' -- once charming characters, after put in the right places at the end of the original film, are called back simply because another film must be made.  Bruce Willis 'must' act like silly, because he was not before; Matthew Perry (as the same dentist Oz) 'must' act like silly because he believes somebody must kill him, the plot nobody believes now.  Amanda Peet 'must' act like silly for, well, she has nothing to do this time (except for some bumbling 'jobs'); and most damagingly, Natasha Henstrige 'must' sleepwalk all through the new film simply because her role is nothing but a poor excuse for kidnapping plot, which is pointless and thrillless.In one earlier scene, Bruce Willis, now in Mexico, appears with tired face, wearing a pair of fluffy, bunny shoes.  This is the same thing as Christopher Walken did in 'Country Bears' and  that's a bad sign indeed.  You know, these films are  shamelessly craving for laughs, which they will never get in this so obvious fashion.  And as the film goes on, the cast raise the voice (see the scene in a bar), and speak out loud the long, winding, not-so-funny dialogues you can never remember after ten seconds.  Well I didn't because I fell asleep.  Sorry.One thing I should praise is that even in this mess, Bruce Willis retains his charisma to some extent.  I still don't know whether or not he can really act, like Keanu, but he is unmistakeably a star.  In this case, however, that only makes this film more unwatchable.",2,Laugh-Free Comedy That Makes You Sleep,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",2004,2416,"[""'The"", 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'was', 'not', 'classic', 'made', 'surprisingly', 'refreshing', 'tone', 'story', 'was', 'unpredictable', 'ex-hitman', 'timid', 'dentist', 'unique', 'characters', 'including', 'hitwoman', 'wannabe', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Now', 'made', 'sequel', 'frankly', 'do', 'need', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'when', 'original', 'was', 'based', 'premise', 'can', 'use', 'just', 'one', 'time', 'results', 'are', 'lame', 'tired', 'even', 'miserable', 'comedy', 'not', 'funny', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'back', 'Jimmy', 'Tulip', 'life', 'now', 'again', 'danger', 'mafia', 'boss', 'Lazlo', 'jail', 'who', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Pollack', 'Many', 'characters', 'saw', ""'The"", 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'return', 'not', 'Mr.', 'Duncan', 'though', 'central', 'story', 'new', 'baddie', 'Lazlo', 'buried', 'heavy', 'make-up', 'who', 'be', 'father', 'baddie', 'original', 'played', 'same', 'Kevin', 'Pollack.This', 'same', 'ruse', 'used', 'sequel', ""'City"", 'Slickers', 'once', 'charming', 'characters', 'put', 'right', 'places', 'end', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'called', 'back', 'simply', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'Bruce', 'Willis', ""'must"", 'act', 'silly', 'was', 'not', 'before', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'same', 'dentist', 'Oz', ""'must"", 'act', 'silly', 'somebody', 'must', 'kill', 'plot', 'nobody', 'now', 'Amanda', 'Peet', ""'must"", 'act', 'silly', 'well', 'nothing', 'do', 'time', 'bumbling', ""'jobs"", 'most', 'damagingly', 'Natasha', 'Henstrige', ""'must"", 'sleepwalk', 'new', 'film', 'simply', 'role', 'nothing', 'poor', 'excuse', 'kidnapping', 'plot', 'pointless', 'thrillless.In', 'one', 'earlier', 'scene', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'now', 'Mexico', 'tired', 'face', 'wearing', 'pair', 'fluffy', 'bunny', 'shoes', 'same', 'thing', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'did', ""'Country"", 'Bears', 'bad', 'sign', 'indeed', 'know', 'films', 'are', 'shamelessly', 'craving', 'laughs', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'so', 'obvious', 'fashion', 'film', 'cast', 'raise', 'voice', 'see', 'scene', 'bar', 'speak', 'out', 'long', 'winding', 'not-so-funny', 'dialogues', 'can', 'never', 'remember', 'ten', 'seconds', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'fell', 'asleep', 'Sorry.One', 'thing', 'should', 'praise', 'even', 'mess', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'charisma', 'extent', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'Keanu', 'unmistakeably', 'star', 'case', 'however', 'only', 'film', 'more', 'unwatchable']",N/A
