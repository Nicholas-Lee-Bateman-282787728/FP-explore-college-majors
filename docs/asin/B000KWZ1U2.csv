1035770,AK0CENM3LUM28,B000KWZ1U2,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","Origin: Spirits of the Past / 704400023729 / B000KWZ1U2*Spoilers*It is difficult to deny the strong ""nature vs. technology"" theme in so many good anime movies, but like the others before it (Nausicaa,Princess Mononoke), ""Origin"" takes a difficult subject and contributes something meaningful to it.Indeed, in some ways I like this movie more than ""Princess Mononoke"", and that's not meant as light praise. ""Origin"" takes the difficult position of defining nature as the aggressive, destructive force at the beginning of the movie, and trusts that we'll come around to the opposition side at the end: that nature's 'destructive' force is just one aspect of its job as a force for renewal and rebirth - in other words, you can't have life without death and decay. Whereas ""Mononoke"" ends with a sort of plot-induced 'truce' on the part of man and nature (I say 'plot-induced' because nature has definitely gotten the short end of the stick, with most of the animals and all of the gods dead and gone... and the humans openly planning to keep doing what they've been doing all along), ""Origin"" ends on a more triumphalistic note - namely, that trying to fight the forest is futile because in the end, we will all succumb to death regardless.Although it's difficult to stand out as a nature anime, ""Origin"" stands out in other, satisfying ways. Everyone in the movie is pleasantly sane and sensible, from the young girl awakened out of a deep cryogenic sleep, to the leaders of the village she comes to live in, to the children who come to love her, and even to the 'villain' who wants to right the wrongs of his past. It is refreshing to see sensible adults, moderate communities, villains with depth, and children who are more than Mary Sue stand-ins for the authors - something that all movies could stand to see more of. And it is nice to see a forest with a 'dark' side - this isn't a Disney forest where everything is light and good and perfect; though the forest may be justified in its concerns and actions, they are not played lightly or for laughs. If you enjoyed ""Nausicaa"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" and would like to see another take on this common theme of nature vs. humanity, do check out ""Origin"" - you won't be disappointed.~ Ana Mardoll",5,Rich Tradition,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2247,"['Origin', 'Spirits', 'Past', '/', '704400023729', '/', 'B000KWZ1U2*Spoilers*It', 'difficult', 'deny', 'strong', 'nature', 'vs.', 'technology', 'theme', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'anime', 'movies', 'others', 'Nausicaa', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Origin', 'difficult', 'subject', 'something', 'meaningful', 'it.Indeed', 'ways', 'like', 'movie', 'more', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'not', 'meant', 'light', 'praise', 'Origin', 'difficult', 'position', 'defining', 'nature', 'aggressive', 'destructive', 'force', 'beginning', 'movie', 'trusts', ""'ll"", 'come', 'opposition', 'side', 'end', 'nature', ""'destructive"", 'force', 'just', 'one', 'aspect', 'job', 'force', 'renewal', 'rebirth', 'other', 'words', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'life', 'death', 'decay', 'Mononoke', 'sort', 'plot-induced', ""'truce"", 'part', 'man', 'nature', 'say', ""'plot-induced"", 'nature', 'definitely', 'gotten', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'most', 'animals', 'gods', 'dead', 'gone', 'humans', 'openly', 'planning', 'keep', 'doing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'all', 'along', 'Origin', 'more', 'triumphalistic', 'note', 'namely', 'trying', 'fight', 'forest', 'futile', 'end', 'will', 'succumb', 'death', 'difficult', 'stand', 'out', 'nature', 'anime', 'Origin', 'out', 'other', 'satisfying', 'ways', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'pleasantly', 'sane', 'sensible', 'young', 'girl', 'awakened', 'deep', 'cryogenic', 'sleep', 'leaders', 'village', 'live', 'children', 'who', 'come', 'love', 'even', ""'villain"", 'who', 'right', 'wrongs', 'past', 'refreshing', 'see', 'sensible', 'adults', 'moderate', 'communities', 'villains', 'depth', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'Mary', 'Sue', 'stand-ins', 'authors', 'something', 'movies', 'could', 'stand', 'see', 'more', 'nice', 'see', 'forest', ""'dark"", 'side', ""n't"", 'Disney', 'forest', 'where', 'everything', 'light', 'good', 'perfect', 'forest', 'may', 'be', 'justified', 'concerns', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'played', 'lightly', 'laughs', 'enjoyed', 'Nausicaa', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'take', 'common', 'theme', 'nature', 'vs.', 'humanity', 'do', 'check', 'Origin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Origin - Spirits of the Past: The Movie

This rating is for the visuals.I've seen the Japanese R2 release of Origin. In terms of character designs/development and plot,this movie offers nothing new. You'll have Akira flashbacks when one of the characters starts transforming into a plant. Were it not for the unique, yet satisfying soundtrack, you could comfortably watch this on mute.Where this movie absolutely, completely crushes is in the mix of 2D and 3D animation. The backgrounds are incredibly detailed and vibrant. The action sequences are fluid and look natural, almost lifelike. Visually, everything just seems to click. The art team obviously put a tremendous amount of work into getting this movie close to perfection. If you've seen the Korean animation flick named ""Wonderful Days"" in R2, ""Sky Blue"" in R1, it kind of has that look and feel. Offtopic: Wonderful Days also had the same problem of weak plot, but stunning visuals.The soundtrack is pretty good, with 20th century classical music, J-pop tunes and what sounds like Eastern European-influenced chant.GONZO is doing it big time. In addition to Origin, they also released ""Brave Story"", another 2D/3D masterpiece, in Japan last year. If you like the eye candy in Last Exile, Origin is the movie for you. Although it does not have the character design complexity of SteamBoy or Karas, it is definitely in that class graphically.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","It's easy to get blown away in the first few minutes of ""Origin: Spirits of the Past,"" where we're treated to exquisitely creepy celestial visuals and a gorgeous theme song.It's also a suitable lead-in for this beautifully animated movie about a not-so-distant future in which human civilization lies in dystopic ruins, and a vast sentient forest has taken control. The animation is stunningly lush and complex, and the lone-hero rescuer story is surprisingly moving... and it almost makes up for the fact that the eco-friendly plot makes absolutely no logical sense.When a young boy named Agito stumbles on an underground chamber, he finds a girl cryogenically preserved for the past three hundred years. Toola is understandably upset by this -- and since she has an electronic neck device, her presence angers the Forest, who fear that she might be used by the militaristic land of Ragna. Of course, the Ragnan leader Shunack -- another survivor from three hundred years ago -- turns up to persuade her.It turns out that Shunack wants to use E.S.T.O.C., a mysterious device that will return the world to the way it once was, and Toola rather understandably decides to help him. Agito's only hope for stopping them -- and keeping the forest safe -- is to undergo ""enhancement"" that genetically bonds him to the Forest's trees. But even that might not stop the might of Ragna's armies... and stuff, especially since Shunack is also ""enhanced.""""Origin: Spirits of the Past"" is a gorgeous film -- the animation is lushly-drawn and full of ruined buildings, vines, shimmering glades, great writhing vines and vast moving mountains full of weapons. Some of the more chilling images (such as Agito's dad slowly turning into a tree, or the seeming loss of Toola in a burning train) are exquisitely haunting, all the more so because they aren't played for horror. It is, simply put, a gorgeous piece of work.It also comes up with an intriguing and slightly eerie concept for a sci-fi movie -- that plants engineered to withstand extraterrestrial life would mutate and become the dominant force on Earth, changing themselves even as they become integrated by humanity. The ruinous dystopia that results is both beautiful and disturbing.The problem is, the plot makes no sense: presumably the whole living-in-harmony-with-Forest thing is symbolic of living in harmony with nature. But since the Forest was mutated by humans, wrecked the world, genetically altered the survivors and keeps civilization in a stagnant stranglehold, it's about as unnatural as you can get. And the alleged bad guys just want to switch the world back to its pre-mutant-plant state when man and nature were in balance... meaning that the Designated Anti-Nature Bad Guy is actually the Pro-Nature Good Guy.Evidently, logic need not apply. Even director Keiichi Sugiyama belatedly seems to realize this, so he throws a rather random ""villains will destroy a town"" twist into the mix to the bad guy will really seem, y'know, bad. It doesn't quite work.Additionally, Toola and Shunack are the most likable characters in the mix -- Toola is understandably miserable and freaked by the loss of the world she once knew, and the people with it.

There's little attempt to explain anything, the characters suffer from lack of development, history is glossed over yet is supposed to be a major component, the 3 divided fractions are hardly mentioned, the pacing is haphazard.......  It felt more like a synopsis of a movie rather than an entire movie; at times I thought I was watching the trailer, there had to be more to it than this.I will admit I liked the beginning.  The simple uninvolved plot began slowly, enjoyably, but then it abruptly jumped a point or two when the main character, Agito suddenly becomes PLANTBOY, superhero supreme.  I kept thinking I blinked and missed a scene or two, but no, I didn't.  The pace scurries along after that, rushing to the climactic battle sequence (this involves a walking volcano that somehow manages to bring its supply of lava with it!).  Inside the volcano, another battle was briefly waged between PLANTBOY and the uncomplicated villain who proves that old adage, once a crazy person always a crazy person.And the cause of all the fuss.....a few unruly plants and issues with water rights.The moral of the story, don't tamper with nature.

As I was watching it, I kept thinking ""wow, this looks familiar"" and it hit me: it's simply an anime version of James Cameron's ""Avatar(d)"" just with a different direction. And like ""Avatar(d)"" -it was pointless...Let me say this: the visuals and illustration are top-notch and stunning. There are grand views, lot's of detail and there was a lot of effort into creating them, so kudos to the production company. The voice acting (I only saw the English version) was pretty good, nothing special but pretty good. That's about where the compliments end, from me at least.James Cameron created ""Avatar(d)"" and wowed us all with the stunning visuals and effects but the story was diluted and tired -a re-dress of the same stupid theme we've seen time & time again: Man vs. Nature, co-existing, one special person who is the key to it all, man must temper his ambition and not destroy everything (something I'm not necessarily against) but the same crap.Aaaaaand like ""Avatar(d)"" it addressed the same pointless concerns, maybe in a different setting & plot but nonetheless the same garbage. If you like your anime dumbed-down to humans are destroying the world and nature must keep us in check and we're ""all connected"" -this is your ticket. My advice -rent ""Avatar(d)"" and save yourself some money. This had so much potential and they wasted it on following a formula.

When did people stop enjoying classic plots and themes? Remember fairy-tales, folktales, sitting around campfires listening to stories you already knew but relished nevertheless? This movie is simply wonderful -- stunningly gorgeous visuals, classic characters and plotlines, archetypal themes, all skillfully and impressively executed. If you enjoy these things and don't expect every film you watch to be the absolute pinnacle of originality and complexity -- in other words, if you still have a part of you that delights in simple joys and wonder -- then you will probably adore this movie.I also think many viewers are missing a crucial plot point, which may have been too subtle for its own good. Read on only if you don't want a -*SPOILER*!!!!!!!!A major crux of the story is that when Agito's body has been absorbed by the tree, but his consciousness is intact on another plane, the Forest reveals to him the truth about the relationship between itself and the humans. Agito learns that the genetic admixture that gives humans extraordinary strength and eventually turns them into trees is really a two-way exchange; it also changes trees in the Forest, causing them to give birth to new humans in giant fruits. These new humans appear to be a stable product of the combined genetic material of plant and human. The Forest, seeing that Agito can possibly teach humanity that there is no need for either hostility or separation between themselves and the trees, grants him his human form back. The point here is that even the ""Neutrals"" are not truly living harmoniously with the forest; they still hold themselves apart, trying to preserve that which is in an inevitable process of transformation.

1035815,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000KWZ1U2,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 4]","Three hundred years after a global catacylsm where the coming of an entity called the Forest Dragon wipes out most of human civilization and restores a severely weakened natural world to a state of primal supremacy on the planet, a find from the past shakes up the global balance that's precariously positioned itself.  The vast forest is supreme, but bands of humans still exist and have learned to grow in this new world - only two groups are involved in the movie (there may well be others elsewhere on the globe), one of which lives on the cliffs that border the jungle and have managed to build a fairly prosperous though low-tech existance, scavenging relics from the ruins and existing in a sort of comfortable truce with the forest and the plant-life humanoids that now dwell in it and seem to act as its agents/emissaries.  The other civilization is a militaristic society that's re-industrialized a small slice of territory and whose ultimate aim is an outright war with the sentient forest.  When a pair of young scavengers from the first (cliff-dwelling) groups stumble across an immaculately preserved laboratory/bunker deep under the forest and the ruins, they end up awakening a girl from suspended animation, who went under right at the end of the old world civilization.  She's welcomed into the cliff society but aggressively sought by the militaristic state, who believe that she has knowledge from the past that could help them to restore the world to its pre-cataclysm state.Though the cliff-dwelling society that's aligned itself in truce with the forest is clearly the 'good guys' of the two factions, the industrialized group isn't depicted as gratuitously evil.  Most of its number seek to restore the previous state of the world because they see it as a better future for humanity, not out of any maniacal, blind hate for the natural world or mad powerlust.  They fear the forest greatly, and don't seem to consider that it could have crushed the new human societies at any time but is letting them exist as long as it, the forest, isn't directly attacked.  That's MOST of the residents of the industrialized state; their leaders seem to have a much darker and more control-hungry nature.  The bulk of the industrialized society seems to view the forest and its 'entities' as having started the war with the catacylsm; the forest itself clearly would view that man started it with its widespread destruction of the natural world that forced it to act, with more power than anyone would have assumed nature possessed.  The cliff society doesn't really seem to dwell on who started it, but have long since established a peace with the surrounding forest that leaves both sides from encroaching too much on the other and at peace.  The leaders of the industrial society seem to view that as a weak path.In the days following the awakening of the girl from the past (as it also comes to light that another from the past had awakened before), all kinds of secrets from ages ago, and revelations about the true state of the world, come out, as events that have been building up for years suddenly rush towards a potential armageddon.The movie has one of the most mind-blowing openings ever put on film with the dawn of the Forest Dragon; it also has one of the most...amazing endings ever.  I'd like to describe in what way it's amazing, but that would clearly give too much away.  Just be sure to watch all the way past the end credits to see both the finale and its coda.I know not everyone's interested in such things, but I thought it worth mentioning that the packaging of this movie is superb, with great artwork and metallic-looking, light embossing on its outer sleeve, and a fold-out inside packed with quick looks at a number of the distributor's other anime titles.  Also a great trailer gallery for relatively obscure anime and non-anime titles, too.My sole complaint is that this could have easily been far longer and have lost nothing, there's so much going on it.  It's 90 minutes in length and could have easily been twice that.

1035819,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,B000KWZ1U2,The Man With No Name,"[0, 0]","I have just finished watching this film and let me say it was a good purchase.  I have been wanting to view this for some time after seeing the trailer on Youtube.  While this film is not perfect, specifically in it's story conveying, it is still a worthy addition to any anime collector's stash.**Minor Spoiler Alert**I do not go too much in depth anymore on the plots/stories of films on Amazon.  If you want a thorough review, they already exist here and Wikipedia has a decent outline of the film.What I will say is that this film focuses on mankind trying to live in harmony with the forest.  Of course this is no ordinary forest, but a sentient being created by us hundreds of years ago.  This vegation was being experimented on by scientists on the moon.  One day in an explosive but glorious moment the vegation becomes self aware and breaks free of it's bio-dome and completely shatters the moon and flings itself down to Earth where it becomes the dominant life-force.Note by a tv geek, the moon looks like the shattered moon from 'Thundarr: The Barbarian'.  This is kind of a typical post apocalypic film where mankind is trying to pick up the pieces and start over.  The animation is beautiful and you are treated to sprawling green and red environments the entire film.Now the cons.While this movie is rendered amazingly, it is incomplete in it's execution of it's story.  I got the feeling this was supposed to be at minimum a 12 episode series, that got slashed down to a single film.  There is a lot that is not hashed out enough.  The enhanced humans, the forest birthing children, who were the Druids, the list goes on and on...You will be scratching your head when this film is over.  Also make sure and watch through the credits there is stuff after them.  Perhaps if I had bought a 2-disc edition of this anime I would have been granted a better understanding of the story.  Perhaps disc-2 would have had the writers getting their brains picked in an interview, who knows.  This is a film only, no special features/featurettes.**Conclusion**In the end despite the lingering questions, you will not feel cheated.  The hero does win, evil is stopped, bad guys see the errors of their ways, etc.  If you are a fan of Anime you more than likely will enjoy this feature film.  This is getting a little rare to find though.  I myself had to get the Viridian re-release.  I will say that if the 2-disc edition has some question answering special features in it, I would opt for that.Overall despite it's flaws, this wonderfully awe-inspiring film will win you over with the animation quality alone.  Also the musical score is fantastic and the opening scene is one you will never forget.  This is a solid buy if the price is right for you.  Now on to watch another film I finally got from Amazon, 'Princess Mononoke', I have high hopes for this one.Well that's my 2 cents worth, sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes.

The forest-dwelling druids take their place at one pole of the dichotomy. Mechanized warmongers stand at the other pole, barely able to breath because of the smoke that belches from rows of chimneys. (Sound familiar?) A young couple in love tries to reach across that bottomless divide. (Sound familiar?) Literally - a huge chasm separates the two lands, with Neutral City perched precariously between the two. Then, one side prepare to unleash untold destruction. Well it seemed to make sense at the time.And so on like that. As befits an animated sermon on living green (also literally, in some cases), this consists entirely of recycled plot elements, in an apparent effort to conserve our ever-dwindling supply of new ideas. That doesn't mean it's bad, just that the characters and plot will fade from memory after you've seen two or three other anime.The good part is good, though. Scenery and backgrounds meet the highest standards.
