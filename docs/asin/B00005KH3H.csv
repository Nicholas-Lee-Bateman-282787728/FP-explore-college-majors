662060,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,B00005KH3H,Classic film buff,"[6, 6]","On Friday evening September 6, 1985, my then girlfriend and I attended American Ballet Theatre's performance of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" at the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center.  The tickets were one of my birthday presents to her, but that was hardly the star attraction at Lincoln Center that evening.  As we got out of our taxi in front of the Lincoln Center Plaza several individuals asking if we had tickets for ""Follies in Concert"" bombarded us.  This was a sold out star-studded concert version of the 1971 Broadway musical ""Follies"" at the Avery Fisher Hall with the New York Philharmonic.  As we strolled past the Avery Fisher Hall and the milling crowds there was a palpable electricity and excitement in the air, this was a BIG event!  I gazed wistfully over, wishing we were attending that instead of ""Romeo and Juliet"", even though Juliet was being danced by Leslie Browne the lovely young ballerina from the film ""The Turning Point"".In the spring of next year, this documentary was aired on PBS, and I saw it, and if one wasn't fortunate enough to attend either of the two performances, this was an excellent substitute.  A couple of years ago my wife gave me the DVD as a Christmas present, and it was great to reacquaint myself.  If you have any interest in musical theatre I highly recommend this.  ""Follies"" when it opened in 1971 to mixed to rave reviews ran a year, but didn't recoup its cost, and over the years became a cult musical.  The Stephen Sondheim score is extensive, and when recorded on the original cast album was truncated so it would fit on just one record when it really needed two.  This ""Follies in Concert"" purpose was to get a complete recording of the score and to justify this a special occasion was needed.  So, an impeccable cast was assembled under the guidance of Sondheim that besides singing the score would also enact a limited version of the book.  There would be two performances, Friday September 6 and Saturday September 7, with recordings being done both evenings and compiling the best in the final release.  I had already purchased the ""Romeo and Juliet"" tickets for Friday night, but even if I wanted to attend the Saturday performance given the cast and the subject, tickets were sold out for both dates within a couple of hours the first day of sale.Speaking of the cast, the premise of the show is a reunion of performers of the ""Weisman (read Ziegfeld) Follies"" in the theatre where they were performed that is set for demolition.  The main characters are two unhappily married couples that used to be best friends and have a complicated past together.  They are played by Lee Remick and George Hearn as Phyllis and Ben Stone, and Barbara Cook and Mandy Patimkin as Sally and Buddy Plummer. The other characters are ""Follies"" alumni and include Carol Burnett, Elaine Stritch, Phyllis Newman, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.Stephen Sondheim himself gives the introduction, and then we are taken into three grueling days of rehearsal.  Dry Martini voiced Elaine Stritch sums it up bluntly right away ""This is hysterical, we are doing a musical in THREE days!""  We get a rare opportunity to see the creative process at work, as we see and hear the performers working through their characters and trying to master them.  Insights and worries are shared, we witness their goofs and frustrations, and moments of satisfaction as it starts to come together and work.  You see the performers reactions to their peer's songs in rehearsal.  A serious setback occurs two days into rehearsal when director Herbert Ross is called back to Los Angeles on an emergency.  Finally, opening night and we see all the performers backstage moments before the performance starts at their most naked and vulnerable.  All in all, an invaluable if speeded up, abridged look at the preproduction of a major musical.Now on to the musical numbers, most are uniformly excellent, my only quibble would be quite a few of the numbers are cut and not performed in their entirety, and several are not performed at all, which is a damned shame.  That is the big drawback of this documentary, it's approximately ninety minutes, and it easily could have been extended by another half hour to capture more of the actual performances, a mystery as to why it wasn't.  Still, let's be grateful to have some record of such a legendary gala occasion.Now the highlights in my perception: Elaine Stritch returning to New York after twelve years performing in London knocking ""Broadway Baby"" out of the ballpark with her wry, deadpan delivery finding both the humor and the heartbreak in the words.  ""In Buddy's Eyes"" is haunting in Barbara Cook's delivery, Stephen Sondheim himself raved, saying she had brought an entirely different but totally valid interpretation, much more emotionally moving than what he originally intended.  You can tell Phyllis Newman and her backup singers Lee Remick, Barbara Cook, Elaine Stritch, Betty Comden and Liliane Montevecchi are having a great time with ""Who's That Woman?"" and so judging by the tumultuous applause at the conclusion did the audience, as did I.  There is a quiet, reflective quality as Carol Burnett begins ""I'm Still Here"", that builds in strength and color finishing on a note of defiant triumph.  Retired opera singer Licia Albanese and at the time up and coming opera singer Erie Mills blend beautifully in the sentimental ""One Last Kiss"".  The light, lilting waltz  ""Could I Leave You?""  lyrics are laced with an elegant yet searing vitriol in Lee Remick's rendition that owes much to her being such a fine actress.  Four talented youngsters, Howard McGillin, Daisy Prince, Jim Walton and Liz Callaway have an eager charm and optimism in ""You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through"", that makes you regret this is one of the numbers that is very heavily edited, a pity when you hear their full version on the finished album.In the ""Follies"" section, it's the ladies who excel.  Barbara Cook looking and sounding like a blonde angel in shimmering blue touches the heart in the torch song ""Losing My Mind"" while Lee Remick a very sexy lady in slinky red sequins and boa, is delicious in the tongue twisting ""Story of Lucy and Jessie"".  While Mandy Patimkin has a very melodious tenor, he is aware of it, and tends to need a strong hand to calm him down, ""Buddy's Blues"" is a little too much on the showboat, ""aren't I wonderful!"" side, for my taste.  George Hearn fares much better with ""Live, Love, Laugh"", which is similar to but nowhere near as good as ""Rose's Turn"" from ""Gypsy"", also penned by Sondheim, that being a nervous breakdown in song.Afterwards, the curtain calls with Sondheim taking a bow, and post performance euphoria and relief.  So in closing, yes it's half a loaf, but such a scrumptious, richly flavored one that if you're a theatre aficionado you want to sample it at least once!",4,"""... in a great big Broadway

662061,A23DFB8IUTIZM0,B00005KH3H,Dan Sherman,"[43, 46]","This is a documentary of a 1985 concert performance from Lincoln Center of Stephen Sondheim's 1971 &quot;Follies.&quot;  A really great cast of Broadway greats was brought together for this concert that was basically put together is a few days.  Although the backstage elements of the show are great (e.g., showing actors working through dance numbers, flubbing lyrics, Sondheim talking with the actors), the real interest of the show is in the performaces themselves that make up about half of the 90 minute documentary.  The unfortunate thing about the documentary is that we only see about half the concert, mostly in the form of excerpts.  It really would have been much better to see a COMPLETE version of the concert. One really wonders why this wasn't filmed and made available in some format.  There is, however, a 2-CD album of the whole concert to fill in the gaps.This concern aside, the concert is a great chance to see the likes of Barbara Cook, Lee Remick, George Hearn, Carol Burnett,  Elaine Stritch, and Adolph Green and Betty Comden singing and within the frame of a concert performance) acting their way through one of the great musicals of our age.This DVD is a definite buy!",5,Too Short a Showing of a Terrific Concert,994896000,"07 12, 2001",2001,1195,"['documentary', '1985', 'concert', 'performance', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', '1971', 'quot', 'Follies.', 'quot', 'A', 'really', 'great', 'cast', 'Broadway', 'greats', 'was', 'brought', 'together', 'concert', 'was', 'basically', 'put', 'together', 'few', 'days', 'backstage', 'elements', 'show', 'are', 'great', 'e.g.', 'showing', 'actors', 'working', 'dance', 'numbers', 'flubbing', 'lyrics', 'Sondheim', 'talking', 'actors', 'real', 'interest', 'show', 'performaces', 'make', 'up', 'half', '90', 'minute', 'documentary', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'documentary', 'only', 'see', 'concert', 'mostly', 'form', 'excerpts', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'see', 'COMPLETE', 'version', 'concert', 'One', 'really', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'filmed', 'made', 'available', 'format', 'however', '2-CD', 'album', 'whole', 'concert', 'fill', 'gaps.This', 'concern', 'aside', 'concert', 'great', 'chance', 'see', 'likes', 'Barbara', 'Cook', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'George', 'Hearn', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Elaine', 'Stritch', 'Adolph', 'Green', 'Betty', 'Comden', 'singing', 'frame', 'concert', 'performance', 'acting', 'way', 'one', 'great', 'musicals', 'age.This', 'DVD', 'definite', 'buy']",N/A

662064,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005KH3H,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 3]","Fans hate to admit it, but the 1971 FOLLIES had extremely mixed reviews, ran less than two years, and was a massive financial disaster for its backers.  Even the original soundtrack was something of a failure: rather than spend the money for a double album, Capitol Records cut the score to ribbons and issued a single album partial.  Even so, the score was greatly admired, and in 1986 an exceptional group of performers came together with the New York Philharmonic to make what the hoped would be a definative live recording.  But if you want to hear that recording, you'll have to buy the CD--the at about ninety minutes, the film of FOLLIES IN CONCERT is actually about half as long as the show itself, and at least thirty minutes of the film is devoted to interviews with those working with the project.  So if you are expecting to see the concert in full, give it up right now, it ain't gonna happen.On the other hand, it is interesting to watch the likes of Lee Remick, Barbara Cook, and Elaine Stritch as they prep for their roles in the show--and what we are allowed to see of the show is quite fascinating, with Elain Stritch a knock out with ""Broadway Baby"" Carol Burnett unexpectedly effective with ""I'm Still Here,"" and Mandy Patankin amazing with ""The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues.""  Chopped and truncated as they are in this film, FOLLIES is still amazing stuff.

Actually, no one really knows.  Was it ever actually said that the video of the concert (not the concert itself or it's audio facsimile) was to be a complete representation of Sondheim's show?  That is unsure.Were there problems?  With a cast as talented and, dare we say, as ego driven as this, we must assume so.One problem shown, but carefully glossed over in the documentary, is the fact that the show's stage director, Herb Ross,  bailed out half way through the four day rehearsal schedule, leaving cast and crew to fend for themselves.  He opted to leave because an unnamed film he was involved in the production of (Director? Writer? Producer?"") was in trouble and needed his presence post haste.  The problem is, according to Internet Movie Database, Mr. Ross had no productions released for that entire year as either a writer, producer or director.  Why did he leave?  Was this the cause of the somewhat disjointed performance (including the always-difficult Mandy Patinkin's disastrous performance of ""Buddy's Blues"").  Possibly.Did Ross' defection cause the concert to not be filmed?  Well, the camera's were definitely there.  We know that.  Footage was shot.  Are we to believe that whomever was left in charge of the filming itself decided what snippets would be filmed?  Were camera personnel actually told ""Now when so-and-so starts to sing such-and-such, stop filming?

662067,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00005KH3H,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 2]","I've learned a lot about this production from reading some of the other reviewers commentary below.  One very informative posting included quotes from Lee Remick that it was unlikely that a more complete version of the concert would ever be released since there wasn't more footage in anybody's vault (although I'm not sure why the concert's having been a benefit would have put a crimp on recording it in its entirety).  But I suspect that the fact that it was recorded BEFORE the DVD era was the main problem.  Nowadays anyone filming such an event would probably record the event in full and then--as many reviewers have suggested--included a ""Making Of""  documentary to be included as ""Disk Two.""  Nowadays, I suspect, that kind of packaging would be a virtual given.Whether or not you find the current available product acceptable may depend on whether you're a ""half full"" or ""half empty"" type.  Me, I'm enough of the former to be very glad to have this.  But then, I didn't pay full price AND I had just come off seeing an above average regional production so the story was fresh in my mind (and filling in the blanks relatively easy).It's not clear whether or not, the entire concert would have given neophyte viewers an adequate sense of the plot or not.  Some might say that the plot was minimal to begin with.  Still the audience benefits from knowing who Ben and Phyllis and Buddy and Sally are (by the way, was Sondheim a fan of the old DICK VAN DYKE SHOW?  I mean, BUDDY AND SALLY, c'mon).  The others, sketchy enough in the stage production, are strictly cameos, and that can be confusing.The documentary describes the assembled artists as pretty much a dream cast, and that would certainly seem to be a fair description:  George Hearn, Lee Remick, Mandy Patinkin, and Barbara Cook as your leads with luminaries of stage and screen like Elaine Stritch and Carol Burnett on hand.  While Remick and Burnett are known primarily for their work on TV and in film, they both had experience in the musical theater and more than hold their own in this production.  Cook, mainly a concert performer nowadays, provides several musical highlights, including a memorable ""In Buddy's Eyes.""  Patinkin has been criticized here and elsewhere for hamming it up--and it probably was NOT a good idea to get rid of the ""Comic Sally"" and ""Comic Phyllis"" figures in favor of a straight solo on ""Buddy's Blues.""  I won't dispute the claim made elsewhere on the page that this was done at Patinkin's insistence, but I don't know that for sure.  Suffice it to say that it works so well done as a duet that it's a shame to lose that kind of real life back and forth.  And we all know that Mandy has a strong, sustained falsetto, but it's not used to great effect here.Along with Remick and Elaine Stritch, George Hearn proves most masterful at interpreting the lyrics.  The dramatized breakdown in ""Live, Laugh and Love"" is tough to pull off under the best of circumstances.  To do it successfully as a concert piece, divorced--for the most part--of any real context is quite a feat.  And that's exactly what Hearn does here.There will purists out there (and God love 'em) for whom the fragmented nature of FOLLIES IN CONCERT will never do.  Many would likely have found even a full-length concert version lacking.  These folks make several valid points, not the least of which is that the current product probably would have more accurately been called THE MAKING OF FOLLIES IN CONCERT. But for what it is, it works.  There is a nice flow to it, and even the songs that are abbreviated are not really (IMO) totally butchered.  The cuts do give one incentive to buy the CD, however, which from a marketing standpoint, may have been a pretty clever idea.Seriously, though, if additional footage ever is dug up, a more complete version should definitely be considered.  If the commentary here is any indication, they'd definitely be a market for the whole shebang.

662068,A1YJ2M23KYI2X7,B00005KH3H,"Hernando DeSoto ""Hernando""","[5, 5]","In spite of the fact that I am a Follies Fanatic, junkie, and completist, I missed this concert. Back in 1971, I was too young to fully appreciate Follies and although I bought the OBC and loved it, I didn't get to see FOLLIES on stage before it closed.By the time 1985 rolled around, I was ecstatic at the thought of this revival and planned on buying tickets and attending. It ""sold out"" within an hour or so and I coudn't get tickets. I should have slept on the ground in front of Lincoln Center.Anyway,the concert gave us a new cast recording with almost all the music restored. And then, there was the VHS of this presentation, half-concert and half documentary. I purchased the VHS and, years later DVD. The DVD is only the VHS material transferred to DVD. There were no new additions but I think I prefer the DVD because the sound and picture are ever so slightly better. The back stage comments and rehearsals are wonderful for any musical theater fan and anyone who has ever been involved in the production of a musical on any scale from Community Theater to Broadway. It's fun to see these big name producers and legendary stars have trouble with their lyrics, squirm and get the jitters just like they were novices. It's still hard work, and it never gets easy. But,as Elaine Stritch says waiting in the wings to go on ""It's Fun, Gawdammit!"".  You get all the excitement of an opening night as seen through the eyes of these performers. I actually met Lee Remick not too long after this concert. She was as beautiful, charming and as gracious as one could imagine. I asked her if there would ever be a release of the entire concert and she said ""No, owing to the fact that the concert was a benefit"". She went on to say that she didn't believe the entire concert was even recorded on video, so, there's probably nothing ""in the vaults"" to re-construct. Still, watching Stritch backstage telling jokes and being Elaine Stritch is a howl and finally watching her NAIL ""Broadway Baby"" shows you why she is a legend. I fell in love with Barbara Cook in this concert. With all due respect to the late Dorothy Collins, Barbara's version of ""Losing My Mind"" is such perfection that she renders the song almost untouchable by anyone else. Carol Burnett blew this audience away as Carlotta singing ""I'm Still Here"". As I said, I loved Lee Remick personally but the truth be told, she fell a little behind on ""Lucy and Jesse"". I love George Hearn too, but I found him a little too ""Operatic"" for this musical. The only major disappointment came from Mandy Patinkin. I admire his talent but sometimes he goes too far. He was supposed to sing ""Buddy's Blues"" with Stritch as Comic sally and Burnett as Margie and then decided to do it solo singing all three parts himself. What a missed opportunity! What a Show-off! What a Ham! I had some friends that did see this concert in person. They told me that Mandy ""went up"" (Forgot his lyrics) and had to start all over again during this song. Good for him! Serves him right!I finally saw this show in a revival at City Center not too long ago. It was great. It moved me all over again in all the same places. Broadway Baby, One More Kiss, Losing My Mind, You're gonna love tomorrow, I'm Still here. Even with an entirely different cast, the magic is there. There's more to this musical than meets the ear and it deserves to be seen complete in all its glory.Still, this truncated DVD version is all we have until Rob Marshall or somebody like him manages to get the movie version off the ground.Hollywood was supposed to film this in the 70's. It would have starred Sinatra, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor and Shirley Maclaine. Star turns were to go to Bette Davis (""I'm Still here""), Joan Crawford (""Broadway Baby"") and Joan Blondell (""Who's that Woman"" I guess). Now, even my contemporaries like Barbra Streisand are too old to play the principals. I think I'd like to see Catherine Zeta-Jones as Phyllis and folks from my generation as the old bags. Can't you see Liza Minelli singing ""Broadway Baby"", Bette Midler singing ""Whose That Woman"" and Cher singing ""I'm Still Here"". How much longer will Hollywood wait to do it?I hope Tim Burton's ""Sweeney Todd"" is a huge hit; then we might hve a chance of seeing FOLLIES done as a movie.
