927864,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B000ALM4K8,Aion,"[9, 14]","This series ended up being very disappointing. Echoing the thoughts of others who have the same views about Saikano, it tried hard to be a tragic romance story and turned out to be more boring than depressing - it didn't make me watery eyed. There are series that depress viewers without making it obvious the plan is to pull on the viewers heart strings and there are series that make it so obvious that you expect people to die just to get a reaction, and Saikano is the latter.Before watching I thought it was going to turn out to be a winner in my eyes - Great looking box/DVD art, a depressing sounding story, short length and only a 10 fee required to own the series. I couldn't see how, for such a small amount of money, a fairly highly rated show could fail to meet my expectations. But, sadly for me, Saikano got all the basics wrong.It's a shame because the story had a lot of potential: In the Saikano world Japan is losing a war against a nameless country. The Japanese government decide to make an ultimate weapon to change their fortunes, and they pick Chise, a 17 year old girl with poor grades and physical abilities, to be that weapon. She has to deal with the fact her body has become a weapon of mass destruction and, at the same time, come to terms with being in love for the first time.The first problem the series has is terrible pacing. The first half of the series left me feeling like nothing had happened; like events simply kept repeating themselves in slightly different ways each episode. Chise cried, she had a talk with Shuji (her boyfriend), Chise cried some more, Chise then went off to fight (without the fighting getting shown since that would require money) and the episode ended. The script for each of the early episodes had very little variation, and the characters started saying fake sounding rubbish (such as talking about kids and marriage after being together for 1 week...), which made the show a difficult one to stick with.Even though the relationship between the main two failed miserably for the most part, the series still could've saved itself if the sci-fi elements had been explained in convincing fashion. However, almost as you'd expect after seeing how badly the pacing and love side was handled, the sci-fi parts of the story weren't explained at all. Chise, seemingly not caring a great deal, reveals to Shuji that she, a useless girl who can't get anything right, was turned into some kind of humanoid weapon that can grow rockets out of her back...and that she forgot to ask any important details after having her body irreversibly transformed. From start to finish, that's all you learn about why a pathetic school girl was turned into a living weapon. And, worst of all, it's never even revealed who Japan is supposed to be involved in a war with, as if such a minor detail doesn't matter.If a story is going to work it needs to be explained. Simply expecting viewers to believe that an annoying high school girl (who happens to look eight) would be forcefully turned into a weapon instead of a consenting adult is stupidity of the highest order. How was I supposed to care about the events that occurred if the story seemed far too daft to take seriously?I suppose the damage the snail pacing, fake/generic dialogue and completely unbelievable story did could've been lessened if the characters made me care about them. After all, the key to making a viewer feel something when characters die is to build up their attachment beforehand. But Saikano failed to make me care enough about any of the cast to make me feel anything. Chise acted pathetically, crying at every available opportunity and being a doormat for Shuji whenever possible. Shuji was a plain guy with glasses who managed to get three of the opposite gender, including an older woman, after him...and he played around. Akemi, who was probably the best of a bad bunch, was only there to support Chise and be another female who longed for the glasses wearing male lead. None of them did anything for me; I was almost willing the main two to be killed at times!Aside from the pacing, story and characters (not much really!), the other thing that bugged me about Saikano was the art. For reasons known only to more intelligent people than myself, the characters have a blushing effect going on 24/7 in Saikano...well, either that or Earthlings in the Saikano world have red lines on their faces by default. And the face weirdness didn't stop there; the faces all look silly from the sides due to the way the noses are drawn so small. If you mix those two issues with a lack of animation then you have a problem, and Saikano shouldn't have had problems (at least not with the animation) visually when it's only 13 episodes long. The only plus on the looks side was the excellent use of eye-catching colours.As for the music, the less said the better. The only theme that has managed to stick in my memory is the guitar theme that plays on the DVD menus. I don't even remember the opening and ending themes. The soundtrack failed to draw any emotion out of me, which is quite a serious flaw for an anime that wants to play with my feelings.Overall, Saikano disappointed more than it pleased. I almost dropped it after the first 6 episodes, only ending up continuing to see if the end made up for the first half. Although there was a considerable amount of improvement once the same episode stopped seeming to keep repeating itself and the plot actually started to give me the feeling it was going somewhere, the content wasn't good enough to save what had been an awful series up until that point. And the series wasn't even able to end in style, with the ending being rushed (the world was ending all of a sudden, for no reason) and the conclusion to the events making little to no sense.6.5/10",3,She: The Ultimate Cry-Baby,1223856000,"10 13, 2008",2008,5817,"['series', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Echoing', 'thoughts', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'same',

927866,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,B000ALM4K8,coopertex,"[10, 26]","I can't believe all the high ratings this anime has received. The whole series is absurd not because it is unrealistic and defies all logic, but more because of the flawed characters and the direction in story.So a seventeen year old high school girl named, Chise, is the military's ultimate weapon. At first she may seem like an ordinary girl, but then she quickly transforms into a freaky human weapon. she sprouts wings out of her back, supposedly flys faster than combat jets, supposedly shoots missles from her back and fire bullets from her arm that looks like a machine gun. I keep saying ""supposedly"" because none of these action/combat sequences are shown with any clarity. We don't actually get to see the morphed, Chise in combat, instead we get to see her fly into the sky and suddenly explosions start appearing.Some of you will point out to me of course that this is not an action themed  anime, that Saikano is more of a tragic drama. So let me take it from there, this is a forbidden love type story between two characters, an ordinary high school boy named Shugi, and a very shy high school girl named Chise who seems to lack confidence and is clumsy. The series revolves around their emotions. Shugi just wanted a normal girlfriend, but is shocked to find out that, Chise is not really a normal girl (hence the ultimate weapon ordeal). Chise tries to act like a normal girl but she can never get over the fact that she is not a normal human girl. Every single episode, has the characters constantly crying about this situation. Shugi is conflicted with the fact that he likes Chise, but then sees her as a killing machine...so he cries and cries and cries. Chise feels like like a freak, knowing that she is a killing machine and  she loves, Shugi, but at the same time sees that they cannot have a normal relationship because she is the ""ultimate weapon"", so...she cries and cries and cries. I kid you not when I say that there is too much crying. And I guess the creators of, Saikano, wanted the viewers to be constantly crying along with these anime character as well!Another thing that annoyed be about series is that the characters all speak in broken sentences, there is just no fluidity in the dialog. They don't speak like real people do. If we as humans spoke in the manner in which the the characters spoke here , it would take us several hours just to order food in a restuarant "" I...would...like...to...look at...the menu...please"". In turn having the the voice actors in this series read the script in this manner must have been tiresome and makes them sound less convincing with the way they convey emotions of their anime characters.I also want to point out a disturbing trend in anime in general. The lolita complex is ever more prevelant in ""Saikano"", Chise's character is supposedly 17 years old, but her character's design looks more like 8 years old- she is very short in height and has a kiddy face and a very slender, frail looking body like that of elementary school girl (not a high school girl) Shugi is about about 17 years old as well but his character looks taller and older and more built. Granted that there is no nudity and sex is just implied, but It looks so wrong when they are hugging and kissing. Wasn't anyone else bothered by this imagery?I can only say a few good things about the series but this alone does not qualify it worthy of a purchase. The artwork and animation is very good. the character design and backdrops are are clean, vivid and colorful. The sound quality is also very clean and the music is not that bad. Overall the production quality is consistant through the entire series. The dvd package contain a few trailers of other anime series but the best of all it has commentaries with the voice actors of the japanese talents.Saikano, progresses slowly, has a depressing atmosphere, characters that are constantly crying, a lolita complex, an ultimate weapon with little combat and silly script. Problems which would be remedied with a better production director and better screenplay!If you want to see excellent anime with femme fatal themes, I highly recommend the animes ""Ceres"" and ""Elefen Leid"".",1,Too Much Crying...to the point of being silly,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,4175,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'high', 'ratings', 'anime', 'received', 'whole', 'series', 'absurd', 'not', 'unrealistic', 'logic', 'more', 'flawed', 'characters', 'direction', 'story.So', 'seventeen', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'named', 'Chise', 'military', 'ultimate', 'weapon', 'first', 'may', 'seem', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'then', 'quickly', 'freaky', 'human', 'weapon', 'sprouts', 'wings', 'back', 'supposedly', 'flys', 'faster', 'combat', 'jets', 'supposedly', 'shoots', 'missles', 'back', 'fire', 'bullets', 'arm', 'machine', 'gun', 'keep', 'saying', 'supposedly', 'none', 'action/combat', 'sequences', 'are', 'shown', 'clarity', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'get', 'see', 'morphed', 'Chise', 'combat', 'instead', 'get', 'see', 'fly', 'sky', 'suddenly', 'explosions', 'start', 'appearing.Some', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'course', 'not', 'action', 'themed', 'anime', 'Saikano', 'more', 'tragic', 'drama', 'let', 'take', 'there', 'forbidden', 'love', 'type', 'story', 'two', 'characters', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'named', 'Shugi', 'very', 'shy', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'named', 'Chise', 'who', 'lack', 'confidence', 'clumsy', 'series', 'emotions', 'Shugi', 'just', 'wanted', 'normal', 'girlfriend', 'shocked', 'find', 'out', 'Chise', 'not', 'really', 'normal', 'girl', 'hence', 'ultimate', 'weapon', 'ordeal', 'Chise', 'act', 'normal', 'girl', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'fact', 'not', 'normal', 'human', 'girl', 'single', 'episode', 'characters', 'constantly', 'crying', 'situation', 'Shugi', 'conflicted', 'fact', 'Chise', 'then', 'killing', 'machine', 'so', 'cries', 'cries', 'Chise', 'feels', 'freak', 'knowing', 'killing', 'machine', 'Shugi', 'same', 'time', 'sees', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'normal', 'relationship', 'ultimate', 'weapon', 'cries', 'cries', 'cries', 'kid', 'not', 'when', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'crying', 'guess', 'creators', 'Saikano', 'wanted', 'viewers', 'be', 'constantly', 'crying', 'along', 'anime', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'be', 'series', 'characters', 'speak', 'broken', 'sentences', 'just', 'fluidity', 'dialog', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'real', 'people', 'do', 'as', 'humans', 'spoke', 'manner', 'characters', 'spoke', 'here', 'would', 'take', 'several', 'hours', 'just', 'order', 'food', 'restuarant', 'would', 'like', 'look', 'menu', 'please', 'turn', 'having', 'voice', 'actors', 'series', 'read', 'script', 'manner', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tiresome', 'sound', 'less', 'convincing', 'way', 'convey', 'emotions', 'anime', 'characters.I', 'also', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'disturbing', 'trend', 'anime', 'general', 'lolita', 'complex', 'ever', 'more', 'prevelant', 'Saikano', 'Chise', 'character', 'supposedly', '17', 'years', 'old', 'character', 'design', 'more', '8', 'years', 'old-', 'very', 'short', 'height', 'kiddy', 'face', 'very', 'slender', 'frail', 'looking', 'body', 'elementary', 'school', 'girl', 'not', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'Shugi', '17', 'years', 'old', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'taller', 'older', 'more', 'built', 'Granted', 'nudity', 'sex', 'just', 'implied', 'so', 'wrong', 'when', 'are', 'hugging', 'kissing', 'Was', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'else', 'bothered', 'imagery', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'series', 'alone', 'not', 'qualify', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'artwork', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'character', 'design', 'backdrops', 'are', 'are', 'clean', 'vivid', 'colorful', 'sound', 'quality', 'also', 'very', 'clean', 'music', 'not', 'bad', 'production', 'quality', 'consistant', 'entire', 'series', 'dvd', 'package', 'contain', 'few', 'trailers', 'other', 'anime', 'series', 'best', 'commentaries', 'voice', 'actors', 'japanese', 'talents.Saikano', 'slowly', 'depressing', 'atmosphere', 'characters', 'are', 'constantly', 'crying', 'lolita', 'complex', 'ultimate', 'weapon', 'little', 'combat', 'silly', 'script', 'Problems', 'would', 'be', 'remedied', 'better', 'production', 'director', 'better', 'screenplay', 'want', 'see', 'excellent', 'anime', 'femme', 'fatal', 'themes', 'highly', 'recommend', 'animes', 'Ceres', 'Elefen', 'Leid']",N/A

927868,A12VND3BWSF3PL,B000ALM4K8,Humphrey Dao,"[4, 5]","""Saikano"" is the type of anime that greatly hinges upon your suspension of disbelief and willingness to ignore the inherent silliness of the show's premise: ""What do you do when the girl you love becomes a weapon of mass destruction?"" A tiny high school girl named Chise is involuntarily transformed by the Japanese government into the ultimate killing machine complete with steel wings and missiles that shoot from her back. Her boyfriend, Shuji, struggles with his feelings for Chise and the implications of the weaponry that gradually consumes her. Over the course of 13 episodes, the series slowly reveals itself to be a coming-of-age parable on young love through the lens of war.On paper, ""Saikano"" is a fascinating meditation on the dehumanizing effect of technological warfare, the destructive effects of war, and the power of love as a redemptive force. There are some interesting themes that can be mined, especially regarding the question of Chise's humanity as her mind and body slowly deteriorate from becoming a mechanical killing mercenary. It is her love for Shuji that keeps her from fully becoming a soulless machine. There are also sparks of life when the series ponders about the question of how war disrupts innocence and community. The carefree and tranquil existence lived by Shuji and his friends comes to an end once the first bombs attack their city in the first episode. Families and friends are separated and lives are forever impacted by the destruction of war, both at home and on the front.On screen, ""Saikano"" is just squandered potential. If the series had made the war its central focus, it might have been a brilliant allegory on World War II and the disastrous aftermath of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This, however, is not the case. The fictional war becomes little more than a set piece for the character melodrama. Presented under the vaguest terms, it is unclear who Chise is fighting or why the world is even at war. The only information given is that Japan is one of the last inhabitable places in the world, is under attack by an unknown enemy, and Chise has been turned into the ultimate weapon by the Japanese government to pulverize the invading forces. All the action happens off-screen and we rarely see Chise fight in battle which is an interesting stylistic choice, but one that ultimately hampers the series.The love story too overwrought and histrionic. The melodrama is absolutely relentless to the point of sadism. The creators stack the deck with scene upon scene of soap opera deathbed confessions, emotional breakdowns, and characters screaming at each other about not wanting to die. To add onto that, the series often mistakes copious amounts of crying for good drama. So many ridiculous scenes are repeated throughout the series of either Chise whimpering about how she doesn't want to be a weapon of mass destruction, or of Shuji crying about how much he loves Chise. The series is manipulative and calculated in its aim that it overdoes it trying to present ""Saikano"" as a tragic love story for the ages. You may be griped while watching it, but it leaves you feeling emotionally duped and intellectually dissatisfied once it's over.There's also so much sex that goes on that it wouldn't be totally unreasonable to suspect the series of having a war fetish. A character feels up Chise's breasts on Chise's insistence as he lays dying in her arms. Shuji rips open the blouse of a dying friend and straddles her, reassuring her that he finds her beautiful even in such a bloody, bandaged state. Shuji and Chise have sex on a balcony while Chise is trying to suppress her mechanical urges to kill something, as though one wrong move from Shuji and she'll explode--quite literally. These scenes are all poorly conceived (no pun intended) and executed (ok, pun half-intended), focusing on all the wrong things and coming off as strained or even unintentionally hilarious.The ""Saikano"" box set comprises two individual DVD cases with all 13 episodes spread out on two discs and housed inside a cardboard slipcover. The series is in letter-boxed widescreen but is not enhanced for 16x9 televisions which is a shame. The English dub is atrocious. The actors sound inexperienced and the actor who plays Shuji in particular sounds wooden and out-of-place. The Japanese actors do a better job of selling the melodrama and giving it their all.",2,My Girlfriend is a Bomb--and so is this show,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,4402,"['Saikano', 'type', 'anime', 'greatly', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'willingness', 'ignore', 'inherent', 'silliness', 'show', 'premise', 'What', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'girl', 'love', 'weapon', 'mass', 'destruction', 'tiny', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'named', 'Chise', 'involuntarily', 'transformed', 'Japanese', 'government', 'ultimate', 'killing', 'machine', 'complete', 'steel', 'wings', 'missiles', 'shoot', 'back', 'boyfriend', 'Shuji', 'feelings', 'Chise', 'implications', 'weaponry', 'gradually', 'course', '13', 'episodes', 'series', 'slowly', 'be', 'coming-of-age', 'parable', 'young', 'love', 'lens', 'war.On', 'paper', 'Saikano', 'fascinating', 'meditation', 'dehumanizing', 'effect', 'technological', 'warfare', 'destructive', 'effects', 'war', 'power', 'love', 'redemptive', 'force', 'are', 'interesting', 'themes', 'can', 'be', 'mined', 'especially', 'regarding', 'question', 'Chise', 'humanity', 'mind', 'body', 'slowly', 'deteriorate', 'becoming', 'mechanical', 'killing', 'mercenary', 'love', 'Shuji', 'fully', 'becoming', 'soulless', 'machine', 'are', 'also', 'sparks', 'life', 'when', 'series', 'ponders', 'question', 'how', 'war', 'innocence', 'community', 'carefree', 'tranquil', 'existence', 'lived', 'Shuji', 'friends', 'end', 'once', 'first', 'bombs', 'attack', 'city', 'first', 'episode', 'Families', 'friends', 'are', 'separated', 'lives', 'are', 'forever', 'impacted', 'destruction', 'war', 'home', 'front.On', 'screen', 'Saikano', 'just', 'squandered', 'potential', 'series', 'had', 'made', 'war', 'central', 'focus', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'allegory', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'disastrous', 'aftermath', 'bombs', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'however', 'not', 'case', 'fictional', 'war', 'little', 'more', 'set', 'piece', 'character', 'melodrama', 'Presented', 'vaguest', 'terms', 'unclear', 'who', 'Chise', 'fighting', 'why', 'world', 'even', 'war', 'only', 'information', 'given', 'Japan', 'one', 'last', 'inhabitable', 'places', 'world', 'attack', 'unknown', 'enemy', 'Chise', 'been', 'turned', 'ultimate', 'weapon', 'Japanese', 'government', 'pulverize', 'invading', 'forces', 'action', 'off-screen', 'rarely', 'see', 'Chise', 'fight', 'battle', 'interesting', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'one', 'ultimately', 'series.The', 'love', 'story', 'too', 'overwrought', 'histrionic', 'melodrama', 'absolutely', 'relentless', 'point', 'sadism', 'creators', 'stack', 'deck', 'scene', 'scene', 'soap', 'opera', 'deathbed', 'confessions', 'emotional', 'breakdowns', 'characters', 'screaming', 'other', 'not', 'wanting', 'die', 'add', 'series', 'often', 'copious', 'amounts', 'crying', 'good', 'drama', 'So', 'many', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'are', 'repeated', 'series', 'Chise', 'whimpering', 'how', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'weapon', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Shuji', 'crying', 'how', 'much', 'Chise', 'series', 'manipulative', 'calculated', 'aim', 'trying', 'present', 'Saikano', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'ages', 'may', 'be', 'griped', 'watching', 'feeling', 'emotionally', 'duped', 'intellectually', 'dissatisfied', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'sex', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'totally', 'unreasonable', 'suspect', 'series', 'having', 'war', 'fetish', 'character', 'up', 'Chise', 'breasts', 'Chise', 'insistence', 'dying', 'arms', 'Shuji', 'open', 'blouse', 'dying', 'friend', 'reassuring', 'beautiful', 'even', 'such', 'bloody', 'bandaged', 'state', 'Shuji', 'Chise', 'have', 'sex', 'balcony', 'Chise', 'trying', 'suppress', 'mechanical', 'urges', 'kill', 'something', 'one', 'wrong', 'move', 'Shuji', ""'ll"", 'explode', 'quite', 'literally', 'scenes', 'are', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'pun', 'intended', 'executed', 'ok', 'pun', 'half-intended', 'focusing', 'wrong', 'things', 'coming', 'off', 'as', 'strained', 'even', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious.The', 'Saikano', 'box', 'set', 'comprises', 'two', 'individual', 'DVD', 'cases', '13', 'episodes', 'spread', 'out', 'two', 'discs', 'housed', 'cardboard', 'slipcover', 'series', 'letter-boxed', 'widescreen', 'not', 'enhanced', '16x9', 'televisions', 'shame', 'English', 'dub', 'atrocious', 'actors', 'sound', 'inexperienced', 'actor', 'who', 'Shuji', 'particular', 'sounds', 'wooden', 'out-of-place', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'selling', 'melodrama', 'giving']",N/A
927869,A3F9VH8916IA40,B000ALM4K8,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[8, 14]","I'm dumbstruck by all the raving reviews for this anime; I mean really people, did we all see the same show? I am so utterly confused as to why people consider a sub par anime like this and Elfen Lied: Diclonius Report Complete Collection to be great tragic animes which I've been told are guaranteed to make anyone with half a heart cry. I laugh in your faces. Siakano is nowhere near that good, and although it has its moments, overall it fails almost entirely to deliver on its promise to make me cry. Anyone with a halfway decent sized brain can penetrate the emotional fluff on the serface and see that this emperor isn't wearing any cloths at all, and is instead quite literally walking around naked everywhere. Almost everything is overdone and seems forced, from the plot, to the characters, to the bizarre ending which takes a page fromNeon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collectionplay book with horrendous results.Chise and Shuji are high school classmates in a small beach town somewhere in southern Japan. When the series starts they have just begun going out, but Shuji doesn't seem to care about the relationship while Chise becomes severely attached to him. Meanwhile Japan, for reasons unknown, is caught in the middle of a war with the United States and its allies (one can only assume it's the US, they never say but the ""enemy"" uses American style weapons) and is, obviously, losing ground. To counter the invasion of the American forces the Japanese military creates its ""ultimate weapon."" What is this ultimate weapon? Well it's Chise, the clumsy, small for her age high school girl from some random small town in southern Japan. Sound strange? Well don't expect an explanation about how and why she was chosen; those details apparently aren't of any importance to the story. This lack of an explanation is more then a little annoying though when the war takes center stage and grows in importance. By the end of the series nothing is left untouched by this devastating war, and yet we STILL don't know who the enemy is and why they are fighting. Was the war provoked by Japan or not? I want to know who to root for in the battles but how can I do that when I know nothing about the war?Don't make the mistake, however, of thinking Saikano is an action series, it most certainly is not. Although the war plays a pivotal role the series it focuses on our high school sweethearts Chise and Shuji. One day while walking down the streets of a major city a squadron of planes comes out of nowhere and starts dropping bombs on the unsuspecting people below. Shuji and his friends are caught in the crossfire until a streak of light shoots across the sky and destroys the planes. Chise. From that point on most of the story is about Shuji and Chise crying nonstop about how she's a super weapon and doesn't' want to be. It was sad during the first volume, but as the show progressed and the same scene kept repeating itself over and over and over again it got REALLY old REALLY fast. Chise would say she has to kill because she's a weapon, Shuji would call her a dummy, lights or bombs or something would come out of her back, she'd say she doesn't want to be a weapon, and then they hug, or sometimes he'd rip of her shirt. What a guy.There is also a comical absurdity to the whole love story. Shuji loves Chise but also loves his former teacher, whose name eludes me right now. Chise loves Shuji but loves a soldier named Tetsu on the side, who just happens to be married to the teacher that Shuji is banging back at home. Meanwhile Shuji's best friend, Akima, the one who introduced Chise and Shuji in the first place, is secretly in love with him, while Shuji's other best friend is in love with Akima, all the while Shuji is hopelessly oblivious to everything going on. Ha, how more soap operaish can you possibly get? Warning, warning, cheesy romantic overload, does not compute, brain ejecting from head.Spoilers ahead.But that's not even the worst of it. There is one instance when Tetsu is lying on the ground all shot up, his guts lying on the ground like hamburger meat, and Chise comforts him by, get this, putting his hand on her breasts. Yeah, almost dead Tetsu then climbs on top of her, no joke, spits up blood all over her face while calling his wife's name and then dies. I guess the healing powers of female cleavage doesn't always work (oh God I hope Amazon lets this review go up). Oh, but it gets even better my friend. Another scene stars Akima lying on her death bead after an earthquake destroys their town, finally telling Shuji that she loves him. Sounds sweet and heartbreaking, right? Well it would have been, had she not started talking about how much she'd always wanted to sleep with him. But it gets BETTER. Shuji, being the sensitive ready to please guy he is, then RIPS OFF HER SHIRT and straddles her. She's dieing, and he's ripping off her cloths. Man, I love this guy (that was sarcasm people). As you can see Shuji isn't the most likable guy in the world. He's totally oblivious, indecisive, somewhat of a pervert, and hits girls. Now the first three vices I can somewhat forgive (come on, all guys are perverts to a certain degree) but any guy who hits girls deserves to die. You hear that Shuji? I'm coming for you!So now I have to say something good, and despite all the fun I've been havening at this shows expense there is some good to report. It's not ALL bad, there are some genuine moments of tragedy that tugged at my heart strings quite a bit, as well as some characters who it seems to me should have been the main characters to begin with. Lets start with Akima, Shuji's best friend. She seems to me to be the only strong character in a show plagued by weak, indecisive wimps. She's a jock for one thing, a track star to be exact, but her personality is so charming and overbearing at the same time that I found myself loving her character every time she walked on screen. Along with her, the boy that falls in love with her, Shujis friend (no, I don't remember his name) is also a pretty good character who brings the war to life in a pretty real way midway through the series.The music ranges form magnificent to annoying. The opening song is sub par while the closer is a beautiful melody which is perfect in every way; but the background music is what I had issue with for the most part. Too many electric guitars when it should have been a violin, way too many hard strings when there should have been soft strings, stuff of that nature. Animation was also somewhat less then note worthy. Nothing flashy or really great, just average overall.So, if you want some REALLY depressing anime watchKino's Journey - The Complete Collection,Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set), or EVA, and give this one a pass. It isn't that great, not in the least bit, and you'll never get that time back.Replay value; low.",2,Was this suposed to be sad?,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,6896,"[""'m"", 'dumbstruck', 'raving',

927871,A3SSWZCKFB38VI,B000ALM4K8,LazerBlader,"[0, 0]","Saikano was plainly put: astounding. At first when it starts out it feels like it could go along a generic storyline but it doesn't. Instead it becomes a depressing and emotionally impacting tour-de-force.To put it in a brief non-spoiler summary, Saikano takes place amidst a huge war. Our main characters are Chise and Shuji who lived in a peaceful small town that is not affected by this war...yet. However, Japan needs a weapon to turn the tide of the war and Chise becomes this weaponThis anime successfully depicted the true site of war: not all-the-time glorious gung-ho fighting seen in some movies or video games. But the cold long days of war, filled with death and fear. While going through the series, its just character after character dying in what appears to be a World War going on.Much character development was present as the characters grow up and move on. All the changes happening around our main character Shuji creates another depressing aspect added to the anime. Yet such things happen in real life, these parts make anime even more realistic and human.The interaction and relationships between characters is beautifully orchestrated and human. The uncertainty and fear that troubles are main couple Shuji and Chise are those that occur in many normal relationships, and not just those that have a weaponized girl.As characters die, the way their friends try to move on and coupe is completely natural. Again it is no surprise that this anime has been adapted to a live-action movie (released earlier this year in 2006). I have not yet seen it but definitely looks good, rather than such flops like the live action Sailor Moon.Voice acting in both English and Japanese was well-done and full of emotions. One of the better English dubs I've watched among anime I've seen.The pacing of each episode was great just like of IGPX which was one of the aspects that made that anime enjoyable. Episodes all feel fulfilling and keep on with the story. No filler episodes with this 13 episode anime at all. With the story never stopping with the episodes, can be a plus or a minus. Some may not get as attached to the characters as much and thats a plus to filler episodes in such series like Inuyasha or Bleach. Yet by never side stepping from the story, it makes it makes its impact just more powerful.This is definitely a more mature-titled anime with many deep themes of violence, some sex & gore, and scenes of massive destruction. Again, this isn't a happy-go-lucky love story but about, as the tagline says, the last love song on this little planet. Beautifully animation and story is executed into the downward-spiraling waltz that is Saikano.Few minor complaints:- It's a little short- No explanations of how Chise works as a weapon",5,Very underrated anime: Saikano,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,2756,"['Saikano', 'was', 'plainly', 'put', 'astounding', 'first', 'when', 'could', 'go', 'along', 'generic', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'Instead', 'depressing', 'emotionally', 'impacting', 'tour-de-force.To', 'put', 'brief', 'non-spoiler', 'summary', 'Saikano', 'place', 'huge', 'war', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Chise', 'Shuji', 'who', 'lived', 'peaceful', 'small', 'town', 'not', 'affected', 'war', 'yet', 'However', 'Japan', 'weapon', 'turn', 'tide', 'war', 'Chise', 'weaponThis', 'anime', 'successfully', 'depicted', 'true', 'site', 'war', 'not', 'all-the-time', 'glorious', 'gung-ho', 'fighting', 'seen', 'movies', 'video', 'games', 'cold', 'long', 'days', 'war', 'filled', 'death', 'fear', 'going', 'series', 'just', 'character', 'character', 'dying', 'what', 'be', 'World', 'War', 'going', 'on.Much', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'present', 'characters', 'grow', 'up', 'move', 'changes', 'happening', 'main', 'character', 'Shuji', 'depressing', 'aspect', 'added', 'anime', 'such', 'things', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'parts', 'make', 'anime', 'even', 'more', 'realistic', 'human.The', 'interaction', 'relationships', 'characters', 'beautifully', 'orchestrated', 'human', 'uncertainty', 'fear', 'troubles', 'are', 'main', 'couple', 'Shuji', 'Chise', 'are', 'occur', 'many', 'normal', 'relationships', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'weaponized', 'girl.As', 'characters', 'die', 'way', 'friends', 'try', 'move', 'coupe', 'completely', 'natural', 'Again', 'surprise', 'anime', 'been', 'adapted', 'live-action', 'movie', 'released', 'earlier', 'year', '2006', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'definitely', 'good', 'rather', 'such', 'flops', 'live', 'action', 'Sailor', 'Moon.Voice', 'acting', 'English', 'Japanese', 'was', 'well-done', 'full', 'emotions', 'One', 'better', 'English', 'dubs', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'seen.The', 'pacing', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'just', 'IGPX', 'was', 'one', 'aspects', 'made', 'anime', 'enjoyable', 'feel', 'fulfilling', 'keep', 'story', 'filler', '13', 'episode', 'anime', 'story', 'never', 'stopping', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'plus', 'minus', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'attached', 'characters', 'much', 'plus', 'filler', 'episodes', 'such', 'series', 'Inuyasha', 'Bleach', 'never', 'side', 'stepping', 'story', 'impact', 'just', 'more', 'powerful.This', 'definitely', 'more', 'mature-titled', 'anime', 'many', 'deep', 'themes', 'violence', 'sex', 'gore', 'scenes', 'massive', 'destruction', 'Again', ""n't"", 'happy-go-lucky', 'love', 'story', 'about', 'tagline', 'last', 'love', 'song', 'little', 'planet', 'Beautifully', 'animation', 'story', 'executed', 'downward-spiraling', 'waltz', 'Saikano.Few', 'minor', 'complaints', 'little', 'short-', 'No', 'explanations', 'how', 'Chise', 'weapon']",N/A

I was advised by several people to watch it with a bunch of tissues, because its beautifully tragic tale has supposedly moved many to tears. Unfortunately, I'm far from the emotional type and I remained very much dry-eyed till the end of the series.Overrated was the first word that came to mind after I had gotten over the shock of finishing Saikano. I was like, that's it?! We have two young people in love, but one of them is the government's ultimate weapon in what seems to be World War III. Shuji and Chise struggle to maintain their relationship, but doing so becomes increasingly difficult since Chise is losing more and more of her humanity with each passing day. She's like a walking and talking homing missile, she can detect enemies hundreds of miles away and target them for annihilation faster than you can shout ""Fire!"". What's more, the harsh reality of war is setting in Shuji's world as he starts to lose his friends one by one. Yes, war is cruel and frightening, and Saikano spares no expense in making us see that.Okay, I know Shuji and Chise's plight is sad and all, but give me a break. Episode after episode of lamenting and crying over it is just plain overkill. Shuji and Chise do a lot of mulling over the situation, so much that it makes up something like 75% of Saikano. The series does not even bother to explain how and why Chise became a weapon, and I find it hard to swallow that a high school girl can just suddenly grow and launch all sorts of missiles from her back. What kept me watching was my curiosity, for I could not imagine how it was going to end. Did I just mention the end? Now that was another freaky experience I have absolutely no words for... you'll have to see it for yourself in order to understand what I mean.The art and animation are okay, I guess. Character designs are the typical cute anime fare, but I was disturbed by the lines across all their cheeks. Everyone looked like they were perpetually flushed or blushing. You don't see them on Chise's face in the title graphic above because I photoshopped them away in order to reduce the file size. The scenes' colors are also somewhat muted in order to highlight the dreariness of it all. The English dubbing is delightfully close to the original Japanese dialogues in terms of voicing and intonation, so watching it either subbed or dubbed will pretty much give you the same satisfaction.Saikano had a great concept going, but the plot's progression left a little something to be desired. Maybe it would have turned out better if they had spent less time making everybody cry and more time developing the actual story.",3,Overrated and way too weepy...,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,2668,"['had', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'Saikano', 'was', 'advised', 'several', 'people', 'watch', 'bunch', 'tissues', 'beautifully', 'tragic', 'tale', 'supposedly', 'moved', 'many', 'tears', 'Unfortunately', ""'m"", 'far', 'emotional', 'type', 'remained', 'very', 'much', 'dry-eyed', 'end', 'series.Overrated', 'was', 'first', 'word', 'came', 'mind', 'had', 'gotten', 'shock', 'finishing', 'Saikano', 'was', 'have', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'love', 'one', 'government', 'ultimate', 'weapon', 'what', 'be', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'Shuji', 'Chise', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'relationship', 'doing', 'so', 'becomes', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'Chise', 'losing', 'more', 'more', 'humanity', 'passing', 'day', 'walking', 'talking', 'homing', 'missile', 'can', 'detect', 'enemies', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'away', 'target', 'annihilation', 'faster', 'can', 'shout', 'Fire', 'What', 'more', 'harsh', 'reality', 'war', 'setting', 'Shuji', 'world', 'lose', 'friends', 'one', 'one', 'Yes', 'war', 'cruel', 'frightening', 'Saikano', 'expense', 'making', 'see', 'that.Okay', 'know', 'Shuji', 'Chise', 'plight', 'sad', 'give', 'break', 'Episode', 'episode', 'lamenting', 'crying', 'just', 'plain', 'overkill', 'Shuji', 'Chise', 'do', 'lot', 'mulling', 'situation', 'so', 'much', 'up', 'something', '75', '%', 'Saikano', 'series', 'not', 'even', 'bother', 'explain', 'how', 'why', 'Chise', 'became', 'weapon', 'find', 'hard', 'swallow', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'can', 'just', 'suddenly', 'grow', 'launch', 'sorts', 'missiles', 'back', 'What', 'kept', 'watching', 'was', 'curiosity', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'Did', 'just', 'mention', 'end', 'Now', 'was', 'freaky', 'experience', 'have', 'absolutely', 'words', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'mean.The', 'art', 'animation', 'are', 'okay', 'guess', 'Character', 'designs', 'are', 'typical', 'cute', 'anime', 'fare', 'was', 'disturbed', 'lines', 'cheeks', 'Everyone', 'looked', 'were', 'perpetually', 'flushed', 'blushing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Chise', 'face', 'title', 'graphic', 'photoshopped', 'away', 'order', 'reduce', 'file', 'size', 'scenes', 'colors', 'are', 'also', 'somewhat', 'muted', 'order', 'highlight', 'dreariness', 'English', 'dubbing', 'delightfully', 'close', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialogues', 'terms', 'voicing', 'intonation', 'watching', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'give', 'same', 'satisfaction.Saikano', 'had', 'great', 'concept', 'going', 'plot', 'progression', 'left', 'little', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'better', 'had', 'spent', 'less', 'time', 'making', 'everybody', 'cry', 'more', 'time', 'developing', 'actual', 'story']",N/A
