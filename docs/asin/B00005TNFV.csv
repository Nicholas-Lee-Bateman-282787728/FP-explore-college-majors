682129,A36SZI12JHB5ZY,B00005TNFV,"CRV ""CRV""","[0, 1]","I'm giving this DVD 4 stars because the audio quality isnt sharp enough for me to get a true sense of how they sounded at that concert however, the intensity and stage presence that Sully showed here made up for that. I really loved all the songs they played here, even the less known ones which by the way sounded better then their radio hits. This band gets classified as having a similiar style to Alison &amp; chains but, I think Godsmacks music is more catchy and powerfull. One thing I noticed when watching this DVD is their stage setting suggests an ancient mystical environment which made me realize that this is what their sound is inspired by. This is probably why thier sound is not as cheezy as most of the so called hard rock and metal acts we see these days. Thats why I dig it",4,I agreee about the audio quality but this DVD still rocked,1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,792,"[""'m"", 'giving', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'audio', 'quality', 'isnt', 'sharp', 'enough', 'get', 'true', 'sense', 'how', 'sounded', 'concert', 'however', 'intensity', 'stage', 'presence', 'Sully', 'showed', 'here', 'made', 'up', 'really', 'loved', 'songs', 'played', 'here', 'even', 'less', 'known', 'ones', 'way', 'sounded', 'better', 'then', 'radio', 'hits', 'band', 'classified', 'having', 'similiar', 'style', 'Alison', 'amp', 'chains', 'think', 'Godsmacks', 'music', 'more', 'catchy', 'powerfull', 'One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'when', 'watching', 'DVD', 'stage', 'setting', 'ancient', 'mystical', 'environment', 'made', 'realize', 'what', 'sound', 'inspired', 'probably', 'why', 'thier', 'sound', 'not', 'as', 'cheezy', 'most', 'so', 'called', 'hard', 'rock', 'metal', 'acts', 'see', 'days', 'Thats', 'why', 'dig']",Godsmack - Live

682131,A2QZAFBSYPC93B,B00005TNFV,dknight16,"[3, 3]","Rather than repeat what other reviewers have already written, I felt compelled to address the concern others have made regarding the sound and vocal quality. This DVD sounds like the audio was recorded off an open digital microphone rather than straight from the soundboard. It has a bit of an echo to it, and at times the vocals can get a little bit too low in the mix. Overall it is a great DVD, but not the highly produced and polished ""platinum quality"" sound that some people have maybe come to expect. I attended a Godsmack show on this tour, and this DVD is what it sounded like to be there. If you like the band you will love this DVD.",4,Just like being there,1044835200,"02 10, 2003",2003,643,"['Rather', 'repeat', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'written', 'felt', 'compelled', 'address', 'concern', 'others', 'have', 'made', 'regarding', 'sound', 'vocal', 'quality', 'DVD', 'audio', 'was', 'recorded', 'off', 'open', 'digital', 'microphone', 'rather', 'straight', 'soundboard', 'bit', 'echo', 'times', 'vocals', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'low', 'mix', 'Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'not', 'highly', 'produced', 'polished', 'platinum', 'quality', 'sound', 'people', 'have', 'maybe', 'come', 'expect', 'attended', 'Godsmack', 'show', 'tour', 'DVD', 'what', 'sounded', 'be', 'there', 'like', 'band', 'will', 'love', 'DVD']",Godsmack - Live
682132,A2L7JN8R6GQE0F,B00005TNFV,Gunther Haagendazs,"[2, 2]","If you already have the Changes DVD, you can pretty much skip this unless you are a big time Godsmack fan or want to see them performing more songs from Awake other than the title track.  People say the audio is horrible.  That is the major complaint from most reviewers and I have to agree, to an extent.  The worst part of it is Sully's vocals.  In this concert, his audio levels are way down.  You really have to turn up your TV in order to hear him.  However I noticed that his voice seems to become clearer and louder as you progressed through the concert or maybe that was my ears adjusting to the low volume.  To simply put it, the worst part is the beginning and I swear I also hear a slight background ping in the beginning as well from the snare drum.  Other then that problem, this is a pretty decent DVD and show from 2001.  The largest problem however isn't even the fault of the DVD.  If you have seen the Changes DVD, you will be spoiled by how flawless it is and will view this one as being a lame imitation.  If you want to get Live and don't have changes yet, I advise you to buy this one first so you won't be so negative to it the first time you see it.  Last comment: $23?  I wouldn't pay that price unless my life depended on it.  Go to a Best Buy, they have it for a shockingly low 6.29!  Is that an unbelievable price difference or what?

They always give a good performance and Sully does a good taking with the crowd during and in between songs.The concert is 80 minutes, so it's well worth the price. I didn't even think about this until I read the other reviews, but a lot of people complain about the sound quality. As I said, I wouldn't have even thought about the sound quality because it sounded good to me, but then again, I was listening to it on headphones on the computer.

The band members are excellent performers; however, you can't hear the vocals. Even when Sully addresses the crowd, his words are distorted and virtually inaudible.

That is incredible. And, I do mean incredible.

682137,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B00005TNFV,Robert Blake,"[1, 3]","Godsmack is overall a hybrid hard rock band. Why do I use the word hybrid? Because it is obvious they are disciples of Alice In Chains, that is too obvious, but they also are heavily influenced by other bands and that we will discuss later. Overall this is an entertaining concert on video. Entertaining because the set looks medieval and artistic, the camera work isn't that bad, it has good panning, epic shots and excellent close-ups. However, I can't say the same praise for the music. A lot of Godsmack's music sounds repetitive and just like loud guitar riffs with some yelling. They copy Alice In Chains to perfection in some areas. But yet they are still good performers. Singer Sully Erna shows he is a good guitar-player and pulls off one excellent drum solo that shows he is an excellent percussionist. In his leather pants and shamanistic ways I seriously wonder if he is not so much a disciple of Alice In Chains as he might be of Jim Morrison and The Doors. Some of the songs are really good like the Eastern, hypnotic &quot;Spiral&quot; and the equally evocative &quot;Voodoo.&quot; These are the two best songs here. Others like &quot;Vampires&quot; seem like sonic time killers. But they put on a good show above all. Erna never seems boring, the editing is good and artistic. Nothing important is ever missed on the screen (including a few flashing fans). Godsmack is not one of the great bands of our time, they are however, a good hard rock band that can pump-up the house and keep us entertained, at least for a while.",3,Pretty Good Concert,1022976000,"06 2, 2002",2002,1539,"['Godsmack', 'overall', 'hybrid', 'hard', 'rock', 'band', 'Why', 'do', 'use', 'word', 'hybrid', 'obvious', 'are', 'disciples', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'too', 'obvious', 'also', 'are', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'other', 'bands', 'will', 'discuss', 'later', 'Overall', 'entertaining', 'concert', 'video', 'Entertaining', 'set', 'medieval', 'artistic', 'camera', 'work', ""n't"", 'bad', 'good', 'panning', 'epic', 'shots', 'excellent', 'close-ups', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'praise', 'music', 'lot', 'Godsmack', 'music', 'repetitive', 'just', 'loud', 'guitar', 'riffs', 'yelling', 'copy', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'perfection', 'areas', 'yet', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'performers', 'Singer', 'Sully', 'Erna', 'good', 'guitar-player', 'off', 'one', 'excellent', 'drum', 'solo', 'excellent', 'percussionist', 'leather', 'pants', 'shamanistic', 'ways', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'disciple', 'Alice', 'Chains', 'might', 'be', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Doors', 'songs', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'Eastern', 'hypnotic', 'quot', 'Spiral', 'quot', 'equally', 'evocative', 'quot', 'Voodoo.', 'quot', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'songs', 'here', 'Others', 'quot', 'Vampires', 'quot', 'seem', 'sonic', 'time', 'killers', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'Erna', 'never', 'boring', 'editing', 'good', 'artistic', 'Nothing', 'important', 'ever', 'missed', 'screen', 'including', 'few', 'flashing', 'fans', 'Godsmack', 'not', 'one', 'great', 'bands', 'time', 'are', 'however', 'good', 'hard', 'rock', 'band', 'can', 'pump-up', 'house', 'keep', 'entertained', 'least', 'while']",Godsmack - Live
