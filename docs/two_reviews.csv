977199,this is just like an extream when a stranger calls (much much better movie). the idea is really good but its low budget and not suspensful. i thought about turning this movie off twice. once in the very begining when you osee two little kids get stabbed and tied together (disturbing and sad) and in the end. people keep saying that its great to see the star get nude but you see her chest because she's tied up and seeing her friends get killed and the killer walkes over and opens her shirt and forces her boyfriend to basicaly assult her. the acting was really not good. the most i can give this not very suspensul and deffinatly not scary movie is two stars.,N/A

1265655,"Both torture-porn AND a morality tale (killing is BAD!) (yep, that's the message) this film becomes downright silly (complete with glowing demon eyes and a heavy-handed lesson) and throws away an intriguing premise.  Rife with hilarious dialogue (on approaching a farmhouse after a car accident a young couple has this exchange: Him: I hope someone's home.  Her:  Yeah, me too.) and acting replete with serious, slow delivery, this film can only be described as a complete time-waster.",Farm House

1103707,"**1/2After the disastrous ""Ocean's Twelve"" was released in 2004, I ended my review by asking, ""We've already had [this saga] sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?""  Well, at long last that question has been answered, and it has come in the form of a good news/bad news proposition.  The good news is that ""Ocean's Thirteen"" marks at least a slight improvement over the previous installment (but then again that`s not a particularly high bar to jump over).  The bad news is that it is ONLY a slight improvement.For this latest entry in the series (which began, it is easy to forget, with the genuinely entertaining ""Ocean's Eleven"" in 2001), writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien, and director Steven Soderbergh have at least had the wisdom to return the boys back to Las Vegas, not having them traipsing all over Europe, as they did in the second installment, on what seemed like a high-cost junket for a bunch of already overpaid actors.  In ""Thirteen,"" Danny Ocean and his ""crew"" of con artist buddies rally behind the ailing Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), who has just been cheated out of his portion of a brand new casino by his unscrupulous partner, the allegorically named Willie Bank (Al Pacino), who wants the business all to himself.  The plan is to sabotage Bank's place so it will go belly-up even before it officially opens.At the beginning, ""Ocean's Thirteen"" seems like it might turn out to be a fairly decent caper movie, but after about the first half hour or so, a noticeable fatigue and lethargy begin to creep into both the writing and the performances.  Very quickly, the plot runs out of steam and we come to sense that the all-star players - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia, Carl Reiner et. al.- are merely going through the motions, hanging around just long enough to cash their hefty paychecks before heading off to worthier, more artistically rewarding endeavors.  Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Cheadle, in particular, have been striking out on such interesting career paths of late, that, perhaps, their hearts just aren't in this saga much anymore.  And without their acting like it matters, it makes it hard for us in the audience to feel that any of it matters either.""Ocean's Thirteen"" may be better than ""Ocean's Twelve,"" but it's still a largely half-hearted effort that does little to burnish the reputation of the original movie.  I think it's long past time to float this series out to sea so that its fine actors can continue pursuing more worthwhile projects.  We would all benefit from a win-win proposition like that.",N/A
53285,"The first hour of ""Casino"" (1995) represents Martin Scorsese at his best - a mini-masterpiece of cinematic bravado depicting the inner workings of a Las Vegas pleasure palace. Unfortunately, once you get past the dazzling semi-documentary introduction, the remaining two hours become a tired self-parody of the director's earlier crime films. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone cannot redeem a disappointingly melodramatic script by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi. In the end, the ambitious yet overlong ""Casino"" fails to pay off.",N/A

404191,"I'm sorry, but this IS just another 80's slasher flick.  There is nothing outstanding about Maniac - nothing that elevates it or distinguishes it from all the other films of this type to come out during this decade.  I simply do not understand the reverence felt by many horror fans for this silly, low-budget schlock.  I know I will get slammed with non-helpful votes from people who have already seen it and like it, (in which case I don't see how my review could be helpful or otherwise...) but I hope to possibly dissuade others from making the same mistake I did by purchasing this movie.Joe Spinell plays Frank Zito, our whining, groaning, grunting maniac.  His Mommy locked him in a closet a lot when he was a child and turned him into a self-hating misogynist - well, that and a homicidal schizophrenic.  Frank scalps his victims and uses these scalps as wigs for his beloved mannequins.  That's the premise.  There is also a lazy attempt at a story involving a beautiful photographer who I suppose represents redemption?  Rehabilitation?  A last chance for the violent schizo to rejoin civilized society?The script is pretty awful and it's interpretation by the actors does not help matters.  Spinell's performance is hokey and self-conscious.  However, contrasted with his supporting cast (I think the mannequines gave better performances than Caroline Munroe) he is friggin Olivier.The scene in which Zito stalks and kills the nurse is the most effective sequence in the film.  However, it is nearly ruined by completely unnecessary and ridiculous over-dubbing.  Whatever the problems with live sound might have been, silence would have worked better.  This superfluous dubbing of grunts, gasps, whimpers and heavy breathing does not add to, but rather negates completely, the desired effect of suspense and dread.  The same goes for the voiceover (in lieu of flashback) that explains the abuse Frank suffered from his mother:Little Frank (played by worst child actor in the world): &quot;No Mommy, please.  Please don't lock me in the closet.&quot;Mommy (played by worst actress in the history of theatre):  &quot;You must be punished.  You have been bad again.&quot;Little Frank:  &quot;No Mommy, please.  Please, please don't lock me in the closet.  Please.Mommy:  &quot;You must be punished.  You have been bad...&quot; and on and on and on.  There are other embarrassing moments in the film, but this one is special.Tom Savini's effects are very good, although the movie is not nearly as gory as I expected it to be.  Some of the shots of the mannequines at the end are nice.  But overall, the gritty, nasty feel that was so obviously desired was sabotaged by a bad script and bad acting.  Great acting is not essential for a good low-budget movie.  But if the acting is bad, then your script must be fantastic, or your premise, or your visuals, or something.  There is some good gore here.  That's about it.If you want to see a dark, gritty, and excellent movie about a serial killer, rent or buy Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.  Abel Ferrara's Driller Killer is not bad either.",Maniac VHS

850973,I watched this series based on Amazon recommendations.  The series reminds me of a long string along movie where you hope it gets good but doesn't and then has a big let down ending.  There is some interesting sex parts and lots of twisted love triangles but that was all it had good.  The entire first season was slow to get the plot going.  Overall a big let down.

1686016,I just finished watching this movie and am extremely disappointed.  It definitely was NOT an Oscar nominee movie in my opinion.  I think casting was a huge disaster.  Sandra Bullock was fantastic.  George Clooney was a joke in this movie.  Definitely not his type of flick.  The movie was interesting but choppy in places.  I think if more thought and expertise was put into the the whole project they could have had a great movie.  The end... absolutely horrible.  I just sat there saying to myself... that's it?  That's how it ends??  The hype about this movie made me think it was going to be something really special.  NO way.

1191291,"I think the idea here was to turn Cormac McCarthy's novel into a film which was more similar to ROAD WARRIOR, however with more literary value and somberness.  Somber they got down.  This is so somber that I had trouble sitting still.  I was getting bored.  The pacing was off too.  I really like Viggo Mortensen and I am thinking of the many splendid movies he has made.  My favorite of his was HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. There sure was nothing somber or leadenly paced about that film!So this is a film about a man and his son who keep living and trudging about in a post apocalyptic world even though they don't have a moment's enjoyment in the lives they are living. The father teaches the son how to commit suicide.  They come across some suicides in a barn.  They also come across a band of marauders.Viggo Mortensen can't save this film and that is saying a lot.

689805,"Monster's Ball is a very intense movie. It garnished Hallie Berry with her Academy Award and I must admit she did a fantastic job, however this movie is not something I would see again. The performances are good and even Peter Boyle is a standout. Hallie tries hard and performs very well.Billy Bob Thorton is also a deep performer in this piece. Coupled with a really weird town and a really backwards thinking community - this movie shows the harsh realities of prejudice, love, hate and rivalry among a father who doesn't love his son and a son who loves his father.I wouldn't recommend this for the faint of heart and it has a real depressing theme - even Hallie's own child gets a strange twist.

Michael Moore fails to realize that unprofitable companies, or corporations with low profit margins, are even less able to pay their employee's the wages they seek.I found this film problematic for a number of reasons.  First, one does not have to live in an area where there is one employer in the entire town.  If one chooses to live in such an area, and this area is economically depressed, they should do what any reasonable person would do: move.  Second, it is unreasonable to expect that the limited skills one has...will suffice for the entire duration of their life.  Sometimes one has to learn new skills if they want to maintain employable.  To think that the nation has to stand still simply because some people do not have the proper skills is unreasonable.  Ever hear of a city college?  Try one.  You can get new skills.  One does not need to lobby Congress or be a complainer.  Instead, I'd recommend 1) going to a location that is hiring and 2) getting some new skills.  You can't lose if you do both.",N/A

860413,"Since this movies conception, there have been numerous references to Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the 1992 classic Batman Returns. 2004's Catwoman has absolutely nothing to do with either Batman, his villians, nor any resemblence to that Catwoman character. Questions have been raised wondering whether Halle Berry could fill the same role as Pfeiffer. Well, in my opinion, no. The depth of acting it took for this incarnation was more geared to martial arts and being sexy in leather. Don't take it wrong, Halle Berry, an excellent actress, wasn't given any true depth of character to work with.The movie seems to be divided into halves. The first part deals with Patience Philips working for a cosmetic company as an art designer who just can't seem to get anything right when it comes to her boss. What began promising at first, turned into a disaster when Catwoman finally arrived about 40 minutes into the film. This second half lost the story with a barrage of leaps and fights mixed with a loose love story.There are a few resemblences to Batman Returns, and maybe these were a nod to it:1. Halle Berry turns towards the camera, crouched delivering the same Meow! as Pfeiffer's character.2. Catwoman, always letting her curiousity rule, goes into a store, where instead of meeting 2 security guards as Pfeiffer's did, she meets 3 robbers.3. Catwoman stands in front of the moon.4. Catwoman nearly falls out the window, and later on, is almost pushed out the window.The references are there, but for anyone who hasn't seen Batman Returns, you wouldn't notice them. There are a few more nods, but I think the point is delivered.So, what's this story all about? Well, if anyone has seen the trailer to Resident Evil: Apocalypse, then you would have the story in a nutshell. In the trailer to RE2 (due this Fall) there's a facial cream that rots your skin and its side effects are toxic. (Funny, I was reminded as well of The Jokers mixture of poisonous toxins he shipped from his factory to shelves in 1989's Batman.)Ok, we have the fired employee who is killed because she found out about the evil corporations secret. A cat performs CPR (or so that's what it looks like), and she comes back to life. There isn't a comic book villian in this movie, ala Joker, Penguin, or Doc Ock (Spider-Man 2). What we have is the ruthless and completely flat corporate executives. There's no depth to these villians and no clever schemes to nab Catwoman, only pin a few deaths on her. There's your story ladies and gentlemen and I think you can pretty much figure out how it turns out.In the beginning, there was so much promise. From the opening credits showing the origins of cats in myth and legend to the meeting she has with the owner of Midnight (the cat who performed CPR.) After that, it was a downhill spiral. I will say that the catsuit was nice and very revealing, however the headpiece looks really odd. Catwoman got her claws from Tiffany's I think (they really do look like designer nails).I have to say, in all fairness, that Catwoman in Batman Returns was a lot more real and the character had a purpose. From her stitched up suit to her makeshift claws. Some may think I was going into this movie with a preception of Catwoman from Batman, but I did not. I had followed this movie since it was first announced and knew it was not the same. I also knew it had nothing to do with the Dark Knight, but I did expect one thing...a good story for the money. Halle Berry is better than a walkthrough part and deserves a good script, she's proven herself as a fine actress. Nothing is really explained in the movie and it's loosely tied together between action sequences and sex appeal.To see, or not to see, that is the question. The answer is up to you.",N/A

926964,"In the passionate, and passionately executed Danish movie ""The Royal Affair,"" also starring Mads Mikkelsen, the extra-marital affair between the doctor and the queen is, in truth, an innocent and brave love, crushed by the overwhelming might of the king and the Danish royal court. The love affair is innocent for the following reasons: the marriage between the Danish king and the British queen is arranged, as it used to be among royalty in Europe. Once the young queen sees the strange and offensive behavior of the Danish king, a spoiled young man who had never managed to grow up, she is deeply disappointed and begins to hate him, although she decides to bear her fate with dignity. When the German doctor (Mads) arrives, she finds out that he is a kindred soul, sharing her enlightenment ideas. The two are strongly drawn to each other, not only by sexual passion, but also by intellectual, political, and emotional affinities.  Although the queen is superficially unfaithful to the king, she does not, in my view, betray him. Her marriage to him was forced upon her, without her say or choice, and his abusive behavior frustrates her well-meaning efforts to draw him closer to her. Where there is no love, there is no betrayal.This is not the case with Open Hearts, unfortunately. (Spoilers) The movie opens with a tragic accident, which could lead to a rich, deep, and thoughtful  movie, but it doesn't. A young engaged couple, madly in love, are driving along the street. They stop to let off the young man, who is going on a hiking trip before he marries his fiancee. As he gets out of the car, he is hit by a passing car and rushed to the hospital.  The verdict is grim: as the fall shattered his spine, he will not be able to move any limb from the neck down--for ever. We feel compassion for the victims, who must pay an unfathomable price for an ordinary mistake. We pity the young woman who visits her fiance in the hospital every day, the whole day, trying desperately to convince him that they could overcome the injury and share some kind of life together. The man responds to her plea with unmitigated, and sometimes sadistic, anger. Filled with self-pity, he rejects her approaches and orders her not to see him again. (Couldn't he be a bit nicer?) She is crushed.This opening is very promising. However, what happens next reduces the film to melodrama. Mads Mikkelsen plays one of the doctors in charge of the injured young man. (It was his wife's car, incidentally, that hit the young man.) In her panic, the young woman turns to him for support and comfort. We are also obliquely informed that his sexual relationships with his wife have vanished long before. Why, we are not told. Is it just a weakening of the sexual flame between long-married partners, or is there a deeper conflict, or hostility, between the two? Well, one can see where this goes. The comfort the doctor offers the distraught and attractive young woman quickly develops into a lustful affair. All right, I understand, perhaps, why the doctor needs sex. But doesn't he know that he is taking advantage of a wounded and vulnerable woman?  And why would the young woman, who hasn't had the chance to digest what has happened to her, and who surely still loves her injured fiance, why would she leap so quickly into the arms of another man (even if he is the handsome Mads Mikkelsen)? This makes no sense to me. What is the value of her love for her fiance if she so quickly plunges into an affair with his doctor? Where are her inner conflicts? She seems to have none. Where is her self-respect? Where are her attempts to stand up, on her own, to the ""whips and scorns of time,"" as Hamlet would put it? And even if she pleads for the doctor's support, must it lead to an affair? I just don't understand why it is so easy for the doctor and the young woman to engage in such a light-headed affair so soon after the accident. Was the director more concerned with the sensational possibilities that the movie offered her rather than with the psychological truths of the characters? If fact, the only dignified character in this movie is the doctor's wife, who is also an excellent actor. At first, she feels guilty about inadvertently hitting the young man with her car and therefore encourages her husband's offers of solace to the young woman. But when she finds out about the affair, she is the one who tells him the truth about his weak and miserable self and thus presents the only moral point of view in the movie. However, she loses. The doctor insists that he is in love with the young woman and escapes his home and his children. Back and forth they go, and the ending is ambiguous.Finally, Hemingway's advice to writers is applicable to all artists. During Hemingway's conversation with Scott Fitzgerald, the writer of The Great Gatsby described how he changed his short stories for submission, ""knowing exactly how he must make the twists that made them into salable magazine stories."" Hemingway is shocked by this betrayal of art and says he ""did not believe anyone could write any way except the very best he could write without destroying his talent"" (Ernest Hemingawy, A moveable Feast, 153).  Hemingway's is a sterling counsel to the rising stars and directors of the new and often riveting Danish movies.",N/A
333658,"Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" explores the twilight years of a person's life when an individual cannot help but reflect on his or her past personal triumphs and regrets. It is a time of introspection when one acknowledges the limitations of a mortal existence. It is also an experience that is not easily translatable to film.Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom) is about to receive an honorary degree for his fifty years of work as a doctor. On his way to the ceremony, he decides to visit places that had played major roles in his life in his younger days. Accompanied by his daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), Borg stops at his family's summer cottage, the town in which he previously worked at as a doctor, and his mother's house. Memories come flooding back at each stop and his reminiscing becomes even more intimate when he picks up a young hitchhiker named Sara (Bibi Andersson) who bears an uncanny resemblance to his first love.If you enjoy abstract films loaded with symbolism then ""Wild Strawberries"" is the film for you. You will have an absolute ball deconstructing the sequence where Borg comes across the clock with no hands. However, if you have trouble warming up to films with unconventional narratives then ""Wild Strawberries"" will be an ordeal to sit through. Sjostrom is absolutely wonderful as the aging doctor but his gem of a performance loses some of its impact because the film is more concerned with giving tangible form to ideas than telling a story. ""Wild Strawberries"" is cinematic surrealism with a vengeance. Bergman wants to translate profound and universal themes into a mass medium but the result is awkward because film cannot truly capture the pure essence behind these themes effectively. The great director should be commended for his ambition in making this film, but the end result is a disorienting viewing experience. ""Wild Strawberries"" ultimately plays more like an experiment than a work of art.",Wild Strawberries VHS
508675,"Psycho 3 was lousy and I agree that Psycho III was the weakest Psycho installment of them all and that Psycho II seemed to be where the Psycho installments stopped being good.As a matter of fact, PSYCHO III seemed to be somewhat like a repeat or a reliving of how the original Psycho was since Norman Bates(Tony Perkins) was just simply reliving his days as a schizophrenic posing as both himself and his dead mother killing customers at the Bates Motel again like he did in the original Psycho, except Psycho III was a lot less heart-pounding, a lot less suspenseful, a lot less mysterious, and a lot less genuine, which is what made PSYCHO 3 lag big time, but this movies predecessors(PSYCHO I and PSYCHO II) were a lot more superb and Anthony Perkins did a much better job at playing Norman Bates in PSYCHO's I and II, but didn't do so hot in PSYCHO 3.Therefore, the PSYCHO sequels seemed to have started losing their touch when it hit Psycho III, since it wasn't as mysterious or as blood curdling as the first two Psycho installations.  So the film makers should've done a better job at making PSYCHO III, because it's not worth the buy, unlike the original PSYCHO and PSYCHO II.In addition to that, PSYCHO 3 was obviously not the most shocking of them all, even though it quoted ""The Most Shocking Of Them All"" on the advertisements. it was Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho I that was the most shocking of them all as well as the original and still the best to this very day, even though I liked Psycho 2 the best out of the whole Psycho series.I also suspect that Psycho 3's reason for not being that great and for not being as genuine or a significant as the first 2 was perhaps due to the fact that Tony Perkins had directed Psycho III as well as being the main character in this movie, but I honestly don't think that Tony Perkins did nearly as much of a good job at directing this movie as opposed to directors Richard Franklin(Psycho 2) and Alfred Hitchcock(Psycho I).In addition to why Psycho 3 wasn't as good as the first 2 Psycho's; the music score done by Carter Burwell wasn't as good nor as creepy nor as intriguing as the music scoring done by Jerry Goldsmith in Psycho II and the music scoring done in Psycho I, although Carter Burwell's music scoring isn't too shabby in general, but Jerry Goldsmith is one of my favorite music composers when it comes to movies.",Psycho 3

The government got desperate and started pushing expermintal techniques.  One of which was a super soldier program that used gene therapy to create a perfect solider.

198308,"OK, Audie Murphy fans, don't bash this review.  Audie Murphy was a great man, and a true American hero.  However, this much has to be said, all of the five star reviews of this movie here reflect a continuing admiration for the man, and not for the movie itself.As a child, I had often heard about Audie Murphy, about his status as ""the most decorated soldier in America"", and his later career as a B-movie star in Hollywood westerns.  Whenever Audie Murphy was mentioned, ""To Hell and Back"", both the book and the movie, were usually also mentioned.And so for all these years, I knew that this movie existed, but had never seen it.  One day, I finally read the book, and then checked out the movie at the local library.  And then I read some of Audie Murphy's biographies.What to say about this movie except that it was almost certainly the high point in the life of Audie Murphy.  Murphy was the sixth of twelve children of desperately poor Texas sharecroppers.  The father would abandon the family and the mother would die when Audie was sixteen.  World War II intervened, and Murphy's natural wholesomeness and survivalist skills as a hunter-warrior would provide him a route to become a national hero and a life as a movie star.""To Hell and Back"" was Murphy's most successful movie.  It was made in 1955, at a time when Americans wanted only to forget the dreadfully inconclusive Korean War, preferring to relive the simpler glories of WWII.  As a war movie, it has all the typical characteristics of that era - an unquestioning respect for the military (and all authority in general), and an unspoken acceptance of the concept (totally foreign to us today) that soldiers' lives are by nature expendable in a war.  Like other war movies of the 1950's, we never see any blood, nor are there guts spraying everywhere, and definitely no mortally wounded soldiers screaming in fear and agony.  Enemy soldiers who are killed fall quickly, silently and bloodlessly to the ground, like dummies.  American soldiers who are killed also fall silently and bloodlessly to the ground, but get more screen time - we get to see their faces contort in agony as they die from their phantom wounds.  Realism having long ago been lost, the heavy equipment of war - the tanks and other weapons - are also not quite right.  The burning M10 tank destroyer that Audie Murphy jumped on becomes a more readily procurable Sherman tank.  German tanks are substituted by the then prevalent M41 Walker Bulldogs.No, this is not ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Nor ""Platoon"".  Nor ""Apocalypse Now"".  This is not even ""The Longest Day"".  War movies are never meant to be documentaries, and thus are always limited in their depiction of real war by the social constraints of the times, and the Hollywood need to put a spin on a story that will bring in the customers.What I find most sad about ""To Hell and Back"", having read Audie Murphy's biographies now, is that his real story was much better:  Murphy's bravery, fighting skills, and exploits were even more astounding than what was depicted in this most sanitized and unrealistic of war movies.  Achieving all of that in the context of the poverty that he grew up in was even more amazing.  Much of this was because the ever modest Audie Murphy refused to allow his life and his exploits to be glamorized.Yes, Audie Murphy's story needs to be remade.  But such a story would find no currency in today's Hollywood - imagine that, a movie about a young white man, pulling himself out of poverty by becoming a soldier for his country, fighting for over two years continuously, and excelling at the art of war.  And then returning home as a hero, and finding even more success in life as a movie star, thanks to the help of many fellow Americans (James Cagney among them).  ""To Hell and Back"" was indeed the product of a different time.",N/A

That said, I found it ironic that a large percentage of the staff who were treating the anorexic/bulimic patients at Renfrew were themselves obese. This struck me as bizarre, but it was never addressed, or even acknowledged. The message, which came through loud and clear, is that at Renfrew it's acceptable to be overweight and unhealthy, but not acceptable to be underweight and unhealthy. A lot of the staff seemed nearly as messed up psychologically as the patients, and some of them were creepily reminiscent of Nurse Ratched, especially in the awful group session/meeting in which one of the more cruel staff members succeeds in getting one patient (Shelly, a psychiatric nurse????) to rat out another (Polly), with the result that Polly is labeled a troublemaker and evicted from Renfrew.

635847,"Films based on comic books are a bit of a mixed bag.  While never my favorite genre, the stakes have been raised in recent years.  With sophisticated outings such as ""Batman Begins"", ""X-Men 2"", and ""Spiderman 2"" and ""Superman Returns"", it seems that we've ushered in an age of comic book adaptations as art.  These films surprised me and entertained me (as any movie should), but also utilized real drama, intelligence and adult sensibilities--often with great performances and smart, logical scripts.  Even graphic novels have become a popular source for serious minded films.So ""The Fantastic Four"" is a throwback.  Far from sophisticated, it plays as a live action cartoon.  That might be OK, but the more pressing problem is that it's not particularly fun either.  I know a lot of people feel that ""The Incredibles"" borrowed heavily from ""The Fantastic Four"" concept, and maybe so.  But at least on film ""The Incredibles"" was rousing entertainment.  Maybe the film ""Fantastic Four"" should have taken that cue.I won't blame the actors.  I actually like many of them (in other roles).  It's a lackluster, sloppy script.  The filmmakers never really cared about this subject and it shows.  First and foremost, they wanted a commercial film to play to a mass audience--kiddies included.  And I can imagine small children getting a few chuckles from The Human Torch and The Thing.  Their interactions, after all, are the equivalent of junior high taunting.  But it's just not funny enough, the effects aren't original enough, and it sure lacks a brain.

833645,"I undoubtedly a fan of the whole Degrassi series.  I started out watching Degrassi Junior High when I was in high school.  I could so relate to the series.  When Michelle's father burned the food & started crying after his wife walked out that was my life!!  I felt a certain affinity for Michelle for packing up & moving out because she couldn't stand her fathers racism towards her new boyfriend BLT.My main problem with the new generation is that the children act like adults.  Sure in the first season the kids pretty much acted like kids but they quickly grew up and became super glammed up tiny adults.  I could hardly listen to Paige go on & on about how wonderful she's going to do at Banting College.  She gets into Banting only to freak out, burn down her dorm room & drop out.  Paige has a crush on Alex who turns to stripping instead of college.  I can't relate to either of those characters.  When I was in high school I did not have it all figured out.  I hardly have it more figured out now.  It doesn't sit well with me to watch 15 year olds wax on about how their lives are going to be wonderful once they get discovered like Manny wants to be.  I could care less about Craig.  When his character was introduced there was an air of mystery about him.  He's quickly turned into the typical guy with a tiny bit of talent who uses his charm to seduce any girl he can.  I don't find his character attractive.  I didn't know nor do I know any 16 year olds who are touring the world or going around to pubs playing music and snorting coke.  Sorry, doesn't happen that often in the real world.  Craig talks Ashley into sleeping with him at the same time he's sleeping with Manny who winds up pregnant. I still don't understand how Manny knew the baby was Craig's & not Sully's since she was sleeping with them both at the same time. In a perfect world, Ashley would see through Craig for what he was.  She goes on this tangent about how she wanted to DIEEEEEE last semester.  I remember crushes in high school and feeling that bad also but at some point you need to get a grip & move on.I feel Caitlin needs to do the same thing.  I can't believe that she is STILL stuck on Joey.  In Degrassi High, Joey basically did a Craig on Caitlin.  Joey slept with Tessa Campeneli while he slept with Caitlin for the first time.  If I were Caitlin I'd declare Joey dead to me.  I wouldn't get caught back into the madness 15 years later!!!I find Peter super annoying.  I can totally see how his character could suck some gullible gals in.  Looks wise he's attractive but I don't find anything else about him attractive.  Sure he posted the video of Manny pulling down her top at a party in the bathroom all over the school that was half his problem and half Manny's. Just because Manny was drunk doesn't mean that she's innocent of her actions.  I also have a problem with Emma.  She started out as this odd looking blonde string bean and she blossomed into a very pretty girl but I think she takes it too far.  I have a problem with her over made up look in every frame.  She's in high school!!  I don't understand the whole cheer squad thing as well.  Aren't there any ""Adults"" who are leading the squad?  How in the world can the school of Degrassi let high school students choose who gets to be on the squad and who doesn't?I know this post is rambling but it lays out some of the problems I have with the show.

254983,"Star Trek V has a bad reputation. The criticism of the film has been so harsh that actually watching it might be a pleasant surprise, as long as you're in a charitable mood. Sure, it is definitely the worst of thefirst sixStar Trek movies. But, for the first two-thirds, it's a reasonably interesting adventure, which at least is more than I can say aboutGenerationsandNemesis.The first act isn't bad. Kirk's assault on Paradise City is a competent action scene, and Chekov has a good scene (that doesn't involve him getting hurt, for once) where he tries to distract Sybok by posing as the captain. Sybok is one of the less interesting villains in the series (again, Generations makes him look pretty good), but he shows some charisma in the opening scene, where he converts some guy in the desert.Also, I actually don't mind the goofy humour in the script. I could have done without the more slapstick moments (the one where Scotty hits his head on a bulkhead is just kind of mean), but the scenes on El Capitan and around the campfire are actually surprisingly good. Although McCoy is maybe too much of an angry old man and not enough of a good-natured ironist, at least he's finally hanging out with Kirk and Spock, and gets more dialogue than usual. Kirk's thoughts on dying alone are truly affecting (Shatner makes the lines sound like the product of genuine reflection), and underscore the friendship that forms the biggest theme of the original series. The small bits with Chekov and Sulu getting lost, and Uhura bringing Scotty dinner, are also quite nice. Not every Star Trek story has to be serious, sometimes it's okay to have a light-hearted adventure while showing the characters being comfortable in their decades-long interactions.The second act, where Kirk, Spock and McCoy evade Sybok aboard the Enterprise, is also pretty good. I'm not fond of the big revelation about Sybok's relation to Spock -- it's one of those huge plot twists that have never been so much as suggested in the entire history of Star Trek up to this moment, then are totally forgotten as soon as they serve their purpose in the movie. It would have accomplished the same thing if they had just been childhood friends, or something. But the scene where Sybok uses his method on Spock and McCoy is excellent. DeForest Kelley gives the best performance of all his years of playing McCoy, convincingly showing how his character felt helpless and never forgave himself for not being able to cure his father's illness. Shatner provides the perfect counterpoint to the scene, when Kirk refuses to play by Sybok's rules and snarls that he refuses to reveal his ""pain."" It is very appropriate to Kirk's character.Unfortunately, the third act is terribly bad. Not only does the movie completely forget about the whole Paradise City subplot, but the resolution of Sybok's mystical quest is unbelievably dumb. Imagine ifThe Motion Picturehad ended with a gunfight against giant robots, and you have something like the ending of The Final Frontier. Allegedly, Paramount stiffed Shatner on the special effects money, but it's not their fault. Sadly, the blame belongs entirely withShatner, who couldn't think of a better ending for his own story. And it's not that hard to think of one. For example, it would have been much better to do something likethat one episodeof Next Generation where Picard discovers a secret message from the earliest humanoids -- that would have conveyed all the stuff about how god exists inside every person, without the lame action sequence. It would also have made more sense than bringing in the Klingonsyet againand making it so that absolutely everyone in the entire crew somehow doesn't notice them decloaking.The problem with the movie is that it goes through a bunch of reasonably good ideas, uses each one only long enough for one plot point, and then discards it. Like how the Paradise City planet and the diplomats are forgotten after the first act (if you're giving David Warner a supporting role, you really ought to give him something to work with), or how Sybok is unceremoniously shoved out of the picture during the conclusion, or how Spock and McCoy accompany Kirk to the planet only to make comments and get beamed out. None of the supporting characters really feels that important to the plot -- they all feel arbitrary, like Shatner is just making up the story as he goes along. Which he probably did.It is a very muddled movie. If you don't like Star Trek, it will confirm your views. But, if you're familiar with the characters, it's watchable and occasionally even good.

701762,"I went into this movie as a lover of the Escaflowne series, but I knew not to set my expectations too high.  I read the reviews and most people said that it is best if you take the movie on its own terms without comparing it to the series.Well I have to admit, that's a little hard to do.  People who have seen the series will be absolutely flabbergasted that their favorite characters and storyline have been butchered into something boderline incoherent.  People who haven't seen the show will likely be very confused and bored by the storyline which seems to cram way to much into too little time (hardly a surprise considering the source material).Although I didn't really care for the character redesigns, I have to say that visually Escaflowne is a spectacular movie.  The opening scene where Van bisects the crew of an airship is worth a rental at least.  The problem is that the creators forgot what made Escaflowne the series so special to begin with.  It wasn't the animation, the giant Gymelfs or even the storyline (although it was excellent).  No, Escaflowne's biggest appeal was the endearing characters, especially Van, Hitomi and Folken.  The problem with the movie is that I actually detested the characters movie counterparts as they exhibited exactly none of the facination of the series.So what are we left with here?  A boring movie with stale dialogue, uninteresting characters and an absolute affront to fans of the TV show that has some remarkably stunning visuals.  Would I recommend it?  No, visuals alone do not make a movie and if you liked the Escaflowne series even a little bit then you probably don't want to see this movie as it will likely leave a very bitter taste in your mouth over all the wasted potential that is here.",N/A

555538,"This dull biopic treats the life of Michel de Nostradamus so superficially that each event is only dressing for the visions that are his claim to fame. Unfortunately, director Roger Christian presents these in such a pop way that by the time Michel is painting a swastika on the wall, the audience is laughing. Perhaps there is no way to present the prophecies visually without failing. It's hard not to view Nostradamus as a know-it-all since we have the benefit of hindsight, but that doesn't explain his efforts to alter what he sees in the world, which you would think is pointless.

The hand drawn animation was fun to watch.  Towards the end it got very violent with a few very scary scenes.  It doesn't matter that it was animated, my 5 year old was scared.  The idea of the movie was cute and the cat was great but the parts of the story having to do with kidnapping, fist fighting until a tooth flies out, and the constant reminder the child's father has been murdered by a gangster was a bit too much.

1518502,"`The Three Musketeers' was suppose to be a fun, rip-roaring adventure about a young Musketeer wannabe joining up with the three titular heroes to thwart a plan to overthrow the inexperienced King of France, stop Europe from plunging into war, get the girl and, in general, save the day.Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way, and even with top actors like Christoph Waltz, Ray Stevenson, Luke Evans, Orlando Bloom, and Milla Jovovich involved, `The Three Musketeers' is a really flat and forgettable affair, the kind of movie where you just can't seem to find anything to hold onto.The actors did their best, but the characters were just too cardboard to feel anything for, the humor was more miss than hit, and even then it was only chuckle funny than laugh out loud, and the action was too superficial and done-before to be engaging - I commented in an early scene that `Milla was going Resident Evil' and wasn't surprised to find Resident Evil series director Paul W.S. Anderson is at the helm - and the whole film just felt like it was chugging slowly along.It's a case of a lot of gloss and little substance, but a film is trouble when it struggles to even make the gloss work.

The script and acting are pretty flat. Since this was made in 1980, you have to keep that in mind when watching. When they finally get to raising the ship, the effects are quite good and worth watching just for that. I would give this film 2 1/2 stars.

948651,"After spending some time watching Dolph Lundgren movies and Jean-Claude Van Damme titles, it was nice returning to a Steven Seagal film - ""nice"" meaning, I could pop the ""Black Dawn"" DVD into my player and enjoy the film whilst dividing my attention with ironing laundry, because there's little chance that Steven was going to do or say anything to surprise me. Fans of his have generally accepted this, since the man has proven himself a guy of repetitious plots and characters. However, it wasn't before long I looked up from my towels to become aware of a couple of things regarding the movie: first of all, it's one of Seagal's prettiest DTV releases I've ever seen, and secondly, there's almost nothing going on in it.In a sequel to Seagal's maligned DTV-emerging flickThe Foreigner(proving that it's possible to expand the franchise of absolutely anything, no matter how bad it starts), he returns as ex-CIA mercenary Jonathan Cold, who is hired by British arms-dealers to help sell parts of a nuclear bomb to a group of Chechen terrorist-martyrs planning to blow up Los Angeles. But after plans go awry and CIA agent/former prot&eacute;g&eacute; Amanda Stuart (Tamara Davies,Scorcher) gets involved, Seagal must both flee assassination and stop the plot to destroy L.A.As said before, ""Black Dawn"" actually looks very good: award-winning lifetime cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski (Tremors) directs the movie with a decent flair for lighting and camera angles, so (with the exception of a couple of atrocious CGI-involving shots) the film manages to look like more than an $8 million production. Also in its favour is the cast, which is one of the better assemblies to be seen in a Seagal film: Tamara Davies and baddies John Pyper-Ferguson (Drive), Julian Stone (Loser), and Nicholas Davidoff play their roles convincingly, and the rest of the cast is clearly making an effort as well.I just wish that at some point, somebody had gone up to either Seagal or the director and reminded them that they were, in fact, supposed to be making an action movie. Much likeThe Patriot, ""Black Dawn"" offers little satisfaction for action-lovers. The cover of the movie is deceiving: next to no martial arts are displayed (and when the single scene does come, it features the worst-disguised body double Steven's ever had), and about two of the three gunfights featured last less than thirty seconds. A decent car chase involving a big rig is the adrenaline highlight, but without any other intriguing life-ending antics, this otherwise-pretty film feels inexcusably bare for a Seagal-starring feature. The plot lacks the intensity to qualify as a thriller and therefore, the movie is left both pretty and useless; no wonder writer Martin Wheeler has had trouble finding work.This non-action aspect slays the film as a whole: a Steven Seagal movie without action is like a hamburger without the beef pattie, and no amount of decent acting or cinematography can make up for it in the end. In this sense, ""Black Dawn"" is the most disappointing of Seagal's recent offerings, because it had so many things going for it that his other flicks didn't, but these were apparently traded for Seagal's bread-and-butter, leaving this otherwise-promising flick duly emaciated. For devoted fans, only.",Black Dawn

254429,"Will Vinton brings his creative genius to the task of bringing complexity and depth to the work of Mark Twain. He does this via putting his Claymation Twain on a hot air steamship to rendezvous with Halley's Comet in 1910, the year of Twain's death. Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher stow away and are subject to Twain's wry observations and humor. Unbeknownst to the kids, Twain's evil twin is also on board, trying to scuttle the journey. The confusion between the works and words of ""light"" Twain and ""dark"" Twain account for some of the journey's dramatic moments.I would have expected a Twain film to highlight Twain's great works - Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. But these are mostly missing, except for a terrifying cameo by Injun Joe. Instead, Twain's lesser known, more difficult and adult-oriented works are highlighted - Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven, The Diary of Adam and Eve and Letters from the Earth. The last, with a terrifying Satan playing life and death games with little clay people, is extremely dark and creepy.Kudos to Vinton for trying to being the ""real"" Twain to life. And kudos with bringing Twain's more difficult works to public notice. Bravo for putting Twain's own sayings into this character's mouth -- though some, like ""as surprised as a Presbyterian in Hell"" are dated and almost impossible to comprehend. Congrats also with showing a man in his humorous and evil-tempered sides. Congrats also for daring to poke pointed fun at Heaven and Hell with any audience.But is this a kid's movie? The subtitle, ""Where dreams become reality,"" seems to suggest this, but is pretty misleading. There is nothing in the story about dreams becoming true -- other than Twain's morbid expectation that he would go out with the comet as he came in with it. And the odd choice of offbeat Twain material makes this a poor choice for introducing kids to the great author. Not to mention that what was included would be nightmare materials for many kids. I think even some 12-year-olds would find this stuff too much to handle.Yet ""The Adventures of Mark Twain"" is extremely well made and innovative, if a bit pokey in the dialog. If anything, it will give non-kids a sense of the mature (and often religious) themes that obsessed Twain. Watch the movie, then pick up ""The gospel according to Mark Twain"" to get the full treatment of his often funny, often insightful musings about religion.",Adventures of Mark Twain VHS

I do not care for Frank Sinatra, Bing is okay, but there was too much singing and the songs weren't even good in my opinion.

I don't go for such lightweight fair, no matter who is in it. As I said, I was glad to see Grace Kelly, but I will never watch this again.

1201268,"Okay, so the first two UNDERWORLD movies weren't gold; in fact, I didn't like the second one at all.  But at the least first was what you expected of it: pure popcorn entertainment, with dazzling special effects, little in the way of real acting, a predictable plot, and a bunch of action (with some gratuitous sex thrown in for good measure).  It's not gonna win Oscars, but damned if it will ever bore you.Well, UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS doesn't bore, either...but it's never what it could be.  Or, rather, what it SHOULD be.  We won't discuss the acting too much; Bill Nighy does the best with what he's given (talk about a great actor in a limited role), and Michael Sheen doesn't even seem to be trying much (can't blame him; watch FROST/NIXON to see this actor at his best).  Again, it's nothing to lament; you didn't expect Shakespeare, did you?  We even get the gratuitous sex, the dramatic violence, even a final ""hell yeah!"" moment between Sheen and Nighy.  And there's definitely a good story here, the clash between vampires and lycans.The main default here are the special effects, or lack thereof.  This movie seems like it was made in the 80s, mid-90s at best.  It's such a disappointment; with better effects, the movie would at least have been engaging to an extent.  As is, UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS can't even seem to muster up that main prerequisite of horror/action shlock: dazzling special effects.

507882,"It's an interesting exercise in documentary film-making, but the sources are so dubious, you have to question Broomfield's judgment in relying solely on them. The film is missing something -- it never ties it all  together or pushes its points through to their conclusions.Tom Grant's  conspiracy theory is refuted only from one angle, but never fully explored.  Broomfield seemed to have worked hard to get the film made, but doesn't  seem to have done enough actual reporting. Surely he could have dug up  better people to ask about K &amp; C.And as an earlier review has said,  the film can't make up its mind about what direction to go in.For those  of you seeking proof of a Courtney-headed conspiracy, it's not here,  although the documentary does make a compelling case that Courtney is  manipulative and sometimes vicious.For me, the highlight of the film  came near the end when Broomfield essentially hijacks an ACLU dinner at  which Courtney was the keynote speaker. As Broomfield begins to ask a  question of Courtney, the head of the ACLU shouts &quot;Get off the  [expletive] stage!&quot; Great irony.So, unless you're a big fan of  Broomfield, Kurt, Courtney, or the Mentors, you should rent this, but not  buy it.

ANOTHER buddy comedy with an interracial crime-fighting team.Yawn.I got back from I Spy about ten minutes ago, and I realized that I must right my review now before the (few) significant aspects slip through my memory and into the pit where movies like RUSH HOUR and BAD COMPANY go.Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy star as the klutzy boyish spy Alex Scott (could you come up with a more contrived Boy Scout name?) and black loudmouth boxer... uh... I forget his name. Kelly Robinson. It's sad that I forget, since the screenplay has Robinson repeat his own name over and over and over again. How is it, then, that I managed to forget it? Trust me, it isn't a memory problem.Anyway, Scott is the pushover of the spy world, always screwing up, both with spy stuff and in his social life. He is teamed up with obnoxious boxing champion to, you know, save the world. This time their mission is to uncover the location of a top secret stealth plane that can become invisible both to radar and to the naked eye. It has fallen into the hands of an evil Hungarian terrorist who is about to sell it to an evil Japanese terrorist, who will commit evil terrorists act with it.Scott and Robinson travel to Budapest to track the terrorists and take sdjjjjjjjjjjjjsd... *snort* Huh? Oh sorry. I fell asleep trying to describe the plot of I SPYThere are plenty of action scenes. And there are plenty of jokes. The problem is that the action scenes are routine and uninspired and the jokes aren't funny. No. Eddy Murphy isn't funny here, and neither is Owen Wilson. Oh wait. There is one genuinely funny scene where Scott uses Robinson's street-talk to pick up a sexy collegue (Famke Janssen, who was better in DEEP RISING).I could definitely forgive the film's tired, unimpressive action sequences if only the jokes were good, and vice versa. It simply doesn't happen. Owen Wilson has come a long way since he was swallowed by a giant snake in ANACONDA (yielding a post mortem appearance rivalled only by Jon Voight's) and has since almost become a Hollywood star. I don't blame either Wilson or Murphy for doing this project, because it certainly had potential. But their talents are wasted by the screenplay and ACTION-FLICK-101 direction. Wilson's normally-loveable bumbling charm is exploited to the point of irritation. Murphy is just plain obnoxious. The scenes in which they bicker incessantly are supposed to be funny, but they are so overblown that you can't even hear what either is saying. Which is just as well: I doubt the dialogue they are supposed to be relating is any more entertaining than the sound of their babble.I don't even feel obligated to mention that this is based on a 1960's TV show of the same title, because this movie has nothing to do with the series. It was a waste of money obtaining the rights to use the show's title and premise; besides the title, no one would have noticed the inspiration.There was no reason to make this movie, and if you have seen RUSH HOUR, BAD COMPANY, SHANGHAI NOON, or any other such movie, there is really no reason to see it. Just recently we had movies like The Tuxedo, and there will soon be NATIONAL SECURITY and SHANGHAI KNIGHTS.For a genre that was dead in the first place, it sure it taking a long time to die out.",N/A

774585,"(Warning: Spoilers ahead)Why oh why did I go see this movie? I remember seeing the first Tomb Raider movie, and it was one of the most boring action films I had ever seen. Perhaps I was drunk (or under some sort of influence) at the time. Whatever the case, I went to see The Cradle of Life, and came out ready to go to sleep.In Lara Croft's latest adventure, she tries to stop an arms manufacturer named Reiss from getting to Pandora's Box, which has the power to kill millions of people. To help her she enlists the aid of convict Terry Sheridan, and together they travel all the way from Hong Kong to Africa in search of Pandora's Box.One of my gripes with this movie is that we seem to get too many pointless shots, which I am sure is supposed to wow us, but instead had my eyes rolling away from the screen due to lack of interest. For instance, one scene has Lara and Terry jumping off of a tall building in flying suits to escape some bad guys. It was cool for a very, very short time, but for some reason the camera kept focusing on them flying for what seemed like forever (okay that might be a bit of an exaggeration). It made me want to yell out ""I get the point! They're flying! Big deal!!!"" There was also another scene in which Lara parachutes into a moving jeep that was picking her up. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think it would be easier (and more logical) for the jeep's driver to stop, wait for her to land, then pick her up, but hey what do I know.There is no doubt that Angelina Jolie looks great as Lara Croft in her many skin tight and revealing outfits. However, she often times seems to have no personality, as her facial expression does not change all that often. Also, we get no real insight into the character of Lara Croft herself, and what really makes her tick, but admittedly I don't think that there's much depth to Croft's character in the first place. The sad thing is that I know that Ms. Jolie can act, but it doesn't show in this movie. Is it the director's fault? The writers' fault? Who knows?This movie also tries to work in some sort of relationship between Lara and Terry. But, as with much of this movie, it falls under the category of pointless plot device. The characters don't have any real motivation or need to be together, and in the end the ""affection"" between them seems way too forced and unnecessary.One of the oddest things I noticed when watching this movie was that I did not get excited during the movie's action scenes. I would even say that some of these scenes (like the fight near the movie's start) were actually slow. Some people might attribute this feeling to me being spoiled by movies like the Matrix, but I very much doubt that considering I have seen many post-Matrix action movies that had cool action scenes (i.e. X-men 2, Terminator 3, and The Hulk).So is there anything about The Cradle of Life that's any good. Well...there was this one scene in Africa where Lara was attacked by these weird monsters. That scene actually held my attention for some time. Also, as mentioned before, Angelina Jolie just looks great in this movie.In conclusion, if for some reason you enjoyed the first Tomb Raider movie, than you will most likely enjoy this one.

1191083,"""Nine"" contains one of the best modern musical scores, but unfortunately only about half of Maury Yeston's songs make it  into Rob Marshall's miscalculated adaptation of the stage show, which itself was based on Fellini's ""8 .""  The actors, including Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, and Penelope Cruz, are terrific, and the film is beautifully shot. The main problem lies in Marshall and writers Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella's mistakes in handling the material as a musical.In Marshall's ""Chicago,"" the musical numbers were presented as the ""fantasies"" of Roxie Hart's vaudeville-obsessed dreams, and the conceit worked really well--- for THAT film and THAT musical. Unfortunately, the same musical numbers-as-fantasy device is employed here, and it simply doesn't work with this show.  ""Chicago"" is presented on stage as ""a musical vaudeville,"" in which the musical numbers exist in a deliberately ""staged"" form. The fantasy makes sense in the context of Roxie's dreams. Not so in ""Nine,"" where the musical numbers just exist organically within the drama, whether in flashback or in the present. In the film ""Nine,"" each number is presented as a fantasy--but why? The protagonist, flailing film director Guido Contini (Day-Lewis), has no reason to have ""musical"" fantasies--he's a film director.This makes the film ""Nine"" less a musical, than a ""musical,"" in which the songs are not to be taken literally. It's as though Marshall feared audiences would not believe that the characters simply sing because they just DO, but felt the need to make it easier to accept by making the songs ""dream sequences."" Does not work at all--it undermines the drama of the story by abruptly shifting the tone, while also making it lose its integrity as a musical. It's a shame, too, because there is so much talent in this film. This would have worked a WHOLE lot better if more songs were retained and this was just presented as it is on stage--in which the characters sing, not because it's fantasy, but because it's a MUSICAL.",N/A
512660,"I'm rather a latecomer to this movie, as I don't seek out Jean Rollin movies (based on what little I have seen), but as this is supposed to be something of a classic of it's type, I gave it a go  - but it is certainly not converting me into a fan.The slim story sees a dead girl named Catherine unexpectedly revived in her coffin when disturbed by grave robbers. She quickly attacks one of them, and then seemingly in a daze, makes her way rather unsteadily back to an empty castle which is her former home. Her newly living status comes to the attention of her former best friend Helene, who seems to think the best course of action is to keep Catherine hidden in the empty mansion, rather than seek help - even despite the realisation that her friend craves the taste of fresh blood!I was really expecting something more stylish from this movie due to it's reputation, but I have to say I think it's really poorly made. Jean Rollin was no genius, if movies like this are the evidence. Several shots are out of focus, the acting is poor, the dialogue stilted and the gore effects are downright terrible. You can clearly see the tubes that squirt blood from a throat in one shot, and the bag that Catherine is squeezing in her hand to squirt gore from a stomach wound in another. All Rollin seems to be interested in is keeping his actresses nude, for as often and as long as possible. The two leads are both very attractive, and the ornate mansion is very picturesque, but that doesn't mean that Jean Rollin is using any talent to show that off. Anyone who is not part of the main cast is so obviously an amateur, and the direction of scenes involving extras is terrible - they continually stare directly at the camera, in almost evert shot. I guess the lighting is pretty enough in daytime scenes, but at night, everything is floodlit by flat, harsh industrial lighting. And the castle's underground vaults seem to have enough light to grow tomatoes in!I also read that the portrayal of the relationship between the two women is strong enough to carry the film, but again, I don't think this is true either. As Catherine becomes more and more aware of what she is, things get more interesting, and there are moments that hint at some depth, but these are few. In conclusion, I am amazed that people rate this movie so highly. I think it is average at best. It has a lot of nudity, which seems to please a lot of viewers, but having acting and special effects that are as downright poor is they are here, strips this effort of any redeeming value.Just to bang the last coffin nail in, I like the fact that the latest Redemption Bluray and DVD release has a shot of the film's climax on it's front cover that blatantly gives away the ending. Way to go, Redemption.",N/A
1673518,"I really wanted to like this and reminded my family, etc to watch.  But at times Carrie Underwood sounded like she was reciting the lines by rote from a script without feeling them. The previews looked good.  But she seemed honestly too old for the role, not a young girl, a novice nun.  Her deeper voice reinforced that.The actress who played the Baroness sang well, but her character was disconcertingly nice (so politically correct) rather than going for the evil step-mother role.  And what was that nonsense about her being a &#34;corporation president&#34;?  She was a Baroness in the 1930's not a 2013 career woman. Can't they produce a story true to the times it was set in without feeling the need to revise it to the point of politically correct inanity? The story loses much of its historical punch and sense of the times it was set in when the writers do this inane rewriting.Stephen Moyer could not sing; his acting seemed forced at times.  And the expressions on his face were more constipated than stern.  His stuttering and panic when the Admiral showed up with his commission was lame.  I was sadly disappointed in him.Obviously a live TV production is not a movie production, but even for a TV production it was a jangling anachronistic mess.  I was looking forward to a new &#34;stage&#34; production of this classic based on a historical cusp  but then the production dumbed down the history.  Some of the costumes and hairstyles were jarringly not period.  And given this was supposed to be a story about the von Trapp family fleeing the Nazis, I found it grating and ironic that the script had to be so politically correct they refused to even say the name Hitler, in the Heil Hitler salute. To hear them repeatedly  saying just  &#34;Heil!&#34; and having the Captain snapping about people saying Heil  to him and how it offended him (without the Hitler) was just utter ludicrousness.And while she could certainly sing, the casting of the Mother Abbess was another jarring non period note.  Her voice in dialogue was often without inflection too, as if she was reading a teleprompter rather than feeling the lines.I thought the young actor who played Kurt was good, and the actress who played Liesel.  Also, the Dettweiler character.But most of this production, sadly, was just weighed down by bad acting, bad singing, inconsistent production values, and changing what was meant to be a historical story to a 2013 political correctness.But I'm going to be watching my DVD of the original Sound of Music to remove the jangling discordancies of this one from my mind.",The Sound of Music Live!

It all felt completely contrived. There was no depth to anything in the movie either, except for the final speech which was the only 2 minutes of the movie worth watching.Really the whole message of that speech is that Americans (yes Kevin represents most of us) are lazy, ignorant, selfish people who deserve the politicians that we put in office with our ignorance and falling for their manipulative advertisements.

916693,"This movie is trying way too hard to be clever and stylish.On the clever side, it fails badly with all the logic mistakes. There is no way that any of the FBI trainees could have set up these elaborate traps on the fly. Then, while these are highly trained profilers, once under pressure, they stop doing their highly sophisticated profiler talk and instead fall back into the stereotype Hollywood movie trapped prey behavior of shutting off their brain and just accusing the next person of being the killer without thought or reason.On the stylish side, I thought the soundtrack was getting in the way of making this a serious suspense movie, instead turning it into an MTV extreme sport feature. Val Kilmer and Christian Slater have actually very short appearances in this film, maybe they thought it better to leave the sinking ship. The remaining actors are mostly two-dimensional, and instead of acting scared (which they should have been) or at least disturbed, they mostly go their ways like it is still an exercise and they will come out unscathed.If the traps hadn't been so elaborate (and thus unbelievable), this could have been decent entertainment.  If the music had been more supporting of the moods, the stylish factor would have been adequate. If the actors had been reacting like humans, this could have risen beyond B material.",Mindhunters

61450,"The lame old joke goes that you watch this movie for two reasons - both well in evidence in the box cover reproduced here, right above Frank Whaley's head.  For some reason I own this John Hughes-written, Bryan Gordon-directed flick, but I'd never watched it all the way through.  I remember when it came out on video, working in the video store and having a Connelly-crazed coworker who had to put it on all the time, and getting so irritated by the soundtrack and the just plain stupid music-video feel of the thing that I vowed I'd never watch it straight through - despite my own attraction to Ms. Connelly's...uhh...talents.Well, it's not actually as bad as I feared.  Bad, yes - particularly the beginning 20 minutes and a similar chunk at the ending.  I don't know if it's Frank Whaley's Jim Dodge character that is incredibly annoying, or Whaley himself, and I don't know if Hughes wanted him to seem AS annoying as he is - probably not.  He's a 21-year-old compulsive liar always talking himself up who still lives at home in a small town somewhere near St. Louis who ends up in a night clean-up job at Target - after being fired from innumerable other positions.  One thing I found particularly irritating was that the guy seems to belong to a completely different family than the one he is actually a part of - his speech, his intellectual pretensions, just don't jibe.  Not that such things don't happen, but it's played entirely for laughs here and is never remotely convincing.The humor, in fact - this is supposed to be a ""comedy"" after all - is what doesn't work, and surprisingly what really does succeed is the sentimental element that comes into place when Dodge finds that Connelly's rich-girl character Josie McClellan is locked in with him, and starts to bond with her over their mutual dissatisfactions with life.  Here in the central part of the film we get to see Jim's egotistical bluster fade away and Josie starts to appear as something more than an object of desire.  And the dialogue about hopes and aspirations here is actually some of Hughes' better work I think - both Whaley and Connelly seem more natural and at ease during this section, and for a few moments the film starts to approach the kind of feeling that we find in THE BREAKFAST CLUB.Alas it doesn't stay on that level for long, and a subplot about a couple of incompetent (yet supposedly vicious) criminals (Dermot and Kieran Mulroney) that break into the store and threaten the kids is played entirely for broad laughs, and very poorly at that.  And Connelly's many cleavage shots and the infamous scene of her riding a coin-op horse really get to be obnoxious and borderline offensive by the end - which is entierly predictable if even more poorly staged than I would have guessed.If you're  watching this because of fantasies about the young Jennifer Connelly then - well, I guess it might be worth it.  And if  you find the typical John Hughes adolescent/young male arrogance and snottiness - think of Jim Dodge as a just slightly older Ferris Bueller from the sticks - more bearable than I do, you'll probably like this.  Even Connelly can't quite redeem this for someone like me who isn't crazy about John Hughes' take on youth and comedy, but at least it's short, and it does have it's moments.",N/A

754836,"Three years ago, in the movie, ""Almost Famous,"" Frances McDormand played a wise but overprotective mom who, at her wits' end, bemoaned the fact that rock stars kidnapped her son. Now, in ""Laurel Canyon,"" she turns the tables on that scenario, seizing the opportunity with great, obvious and sexy relish.McDormand plays Jane, a frisky, reckless, fortysomething music producer who strolls around her expansive Southern California spread in worn leather pants and an AC/DC T-shirt. She's a little like Sheryl Crow ... or at least what Sheryl Crow tries really, really hard to be.Jane, who starts her days with bong hits and Steely Dan, is having a fling with Ian (Alessandro Nivola), a singer 16 years her junior, and her lifestyle is hardly harshed at all when she's visited by her son Sam (Christian Bale) and his fiancee Alex (Kate Beckinsale).The couple is just out of medical school, wracked by premarital anxiety, and they are forced to move into Jane's rowdy house while Sam starts his residency and Alex writes her dissertation. Alex is studying ""the reproductive behavior of the fruit fly,"" while uptight Sam seems overtly depressed by the fact that his mom is cool enough to have framed photographs of herself with David Bowie and Iggy Pop.Couldn't such serious, studious kids find a calmer place to stay than in what appears to be a successful sub-franchise of the Hotel California? Probably. But then there wouldn't be a movie.As time passes and the lazy afternoons and pool-lit evenings add up, tension grows between Sam and Jane.  Sam starts to become attracted to a co-worker (Natascha McElhone). And Alex gravitates into Jane's world and starts to become attracted to, well, a couple of different people. And then things get really complicated.Unfortunately, things also slow down to a bit of a crawl.  ""Laurel Canyon"" was written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko, whose previous movie was ""High Art,""  a film which was also about a sultry, enigmatic artist surrounded by chaos and lots of chill-time. It, too, was slow-paced and atmospheric. But it also had several really strong performances pushing the movie along, and ""Laurel Canyon"" only has two - McDormand and Nivola, who are both excellent but must support a somewhat sluggish, underwritten movie by themselves. They almost pull it off.Christian Bale, usually a highlight in a movie, gets bogged down playing the moody, resentful son. It's hard to sympathize with a character who, when torn between Kate Beckinsale and Natascha McElhone (the definition of a win-win decision), can't get out of the dumps long enough to at least crack a smile.  He has to be the drag, the person who dislikes the most magnetic, charming element of the film.  So the deck is kinda stacked against him.Which makes me think: Maybe ""Laurel Canyon"" should've been the movie in which rock stars kidnap Frances McDormand's son. If Stillwater, the band from ""Almost Famous,"" had somehow dragged grouchy Sam off on their tour bus before he moved back in with his mom, McDormand could've had the entire movie to herself, and ""Laurel Canyon"" would've been a much more exciting place to hang out for a while.",Laurel Canyon VHS
885611,"2004`s ""Ocean's Twelve"" picks up where 2001`s ""Ocean's Eleven"" left off.  When we last saw them, Danny Ocean and his hand-picked gang of professional thieves had successfully heisted multi-million dollar fortunes from three Las Vegas casinos, then headed their separate ways to start life anew as upstanding members of their respective communities.  However, they've since learned that the past has a way of catching up with a person no matter how much he may try to hide from it, when Tony Benedict, the Bellagio owner, still stewing over the money that was stolen from him three years earlier, shows up on Ocean`s doorstep demanding restitution.  He gives Ocean and his gang two weeks to come up with the $97 million they owe him or face the consequences.  Thus, Danny gathers up the gang once again and heads off to Europe, hoping to lift a few priceless art pieces to stave off certain death (though it`s never made entirely clear just how Benedict is proposing to carry out this rather grandiose threat).  What Danny doesn't count on is that he will be going up against two worthy adversaries - one a detective and the other a rival thief - who will give him more trouble than he ever bargained for.""Ocean's Twelve"" is a disappointment for a whole host of reasons, most of them rooted in the format and structure of the film.  For this second outing, writer George Nolfi and returning director Steven Soderbergh have come up with a ha`penny storyline that lacks the intricacy and elegance of the tale in ""Ocean's Eleven.""  Not only does this caper seem haphazardly planned from beginning to end, but the resolution of it falls miserably flat, providing neither the amazement nor the amusement we expect to find in these kinds of stories.  Perhaps the idea of stealing a priceless Faberge Egg just doesn't rank up there in either chutzpah or style with knocking over a whole Las Vegas casino, and so the enterprise is more or less doomed to failure from the start.  Or perhaps the filmmakers simply failed to find enough for all these characters to do while they're roaming the streets of Amsterdam, Paris and Rome on what appears to be little more than an extended European vacation for some talented but woefully underused actors.  Moreover, there is a side foray involving Julia Roberts trying to pass herself off as Julia Roberts that is inane, incredible, preposterous and embarrassing.  The sequence is indicative of the lazy, half-hearted approach the filmmakers have taken towards both their material and their audience.It's also unpleasant watching the one character with even a smidgen of a moral code crossing over to the dark side at the end of the story - and asking us to get all misty-eyed and choked-up when it happens (at least when Anakin does it, we aren't expected to cheer him on from the sidelines).The high-priced, big-name actors - George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon and Albert Finney - go through the motions, but they seem hopelessly cut adrift by the meandering, substandard screenplay.  Actually, only Catherine Zeta-Jones, as the detective and former girlfriend of Brad Pitt, is given anything of genuine substance to work with here.  All the rest are just picking up paychecks.In this type of film, plotting is everything, and the sad truth is that the plotting in ""Ocean's Twelve"" is pretty damn awful any way you slice it.  We`ve already had it sliced 11 and 12 ways with noticeably diminishing results; do they dare go for unlucky 13?",OCEAN'S TWELVE (WS) (DVD)

400205,"Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie.

To change him up a bit the directors tried to reverse the roles of Stiffler and Finch. It didn't work. Also by now you have to really wonder about Stiffler.

I imagine most women in the 1700s did not have those skills.  The work suggests that the midwife was not stigmatized for her job and made good money from it, so why didn't she pass this trade on to her own daughters?  The work does show her tracking in snow.  Still, Maine, to this day, is icy cold.  Did she smoke meat?  How did her family and other family survive during long, oppressive winters?  Each woman and girl here always has her hair covered.  I imagine this was in order not to catch or spread lice, but the work never says.  When the midwife dies, her children and grandchildren are at her bedside.  I heard this was a common practice back then, but the documentary never says.  The historian notes that the midwife recorded her tasks and not her feelings.

But most of these movies are marketed to women and so moviegoers can safely assume that the sexuality won't be amazingly vulgar and the language will most likely be crass but not over the top lewd. This movie has much more in common with some of the toilet humor male comedies in recent history than the standard romantic comedy.The Ugly Truth is a waste of time with a few hilarious moments but overloaded with foul language, sexual conversations and situations and some partial nudity.

532998,"I was able to watch ""What Women Want"" free of charge.And that is the only way to watch it since it is quite disposable as a romantic comedy. This is one of those films the wife begs to see - if you catch my drift.Now I am not saying I despise romantic comedies. Great ones do exist. This is simply not one of them.The film starts out promisingly enough. The anti-Cary Grant character that Mel Gibson plays finds it necessary to clue his playboy self into what women want materially in order to keep up with the new female boss (Helen Hunt) at his ad agency. Due to a freakish accident (in one of the few genuinely funny scenes in the movie), he receives the gimmick of being able to actually hear women thinking. Blessed/cursed by this gift, he surmises that he can use it to get exactly what HE wants. Wronged by his new outsider boss who stole the position he was due, he subtly begins to undermine her career. But even as he does, he finds her to be more than he imagined, falling in love with her along the way. Think of it as an update of a film in the manner of ""His Girl Friday"".But where that film is a classic, this one is a lesson in how to suffocate a movie. Each minute of running time draws a noose around the neck of the film so by the time it ends its finale is impossible to write. In fact, this movie has one of the most contrived and poorly-penned endings in the history of romantic comedies. My wife and I just looked at each other and said, ""Aw, c'mon!"" To the director/writer, I simply give the advice that it is essential to make the audience buy the ending in any romantic comedy. She failed miserably in this regard and just killed the movie. Sadly, the DVD's commentary track exposes her own trepidations concerning the ending, but she never listened to those nagging doubts and the ending is a mess because of that.Oscar-winning actress Marisa Tomei is wasted in the film. Mel is often forced to do schtick while Oscar-winning Helen is simply lifeless compared to her turn in ""As Good As It Gets"". So much high-caliber talent, yet such torture to watch them flail within their caricatures. When you see the gears grinding, you know the film just isn't working.The DVD offers no great redemption, either. Usually a director's commentary provides some insights, but the director is so self-important it is hard to listen. I feel for the male production designer who joined her on the commentary track because she interrupts him mercilessly. I think the director's misandry is showing.So what rescues this movie from the dreaded one star review? Well, I'm being benevolent by giving it one more for the wonderful Astaire impression Mel does while dancing to ""Old Blue Eyes"". He also provides good laughs during his lame attempt to get in touch with his feminine side (just before receiving his supernatural ability.)In short, skip this one and buy something worthy like ""A Room with a View"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""Bringing Up Baby"", or ""When Harry Met Sally"".",N/A

In what universe would someone with Laine Hanson's (Joan Allen) views ever have been a Republican?  And it is strongly implied that her father (Philip Baker Hall), a former governor, was a Republican, yet he is adamantly opposed to any expression of religion.  Then there's the part where, after the governor of Virginia (CSI's William Petersen) tries in vain to rescue a drowning woman, the president's chief of staff (Sam Elliott) says to the Va. governor when he is not tapped to be vice president, ""we don't need another Chappaquiddick.""  Uh...sorry guys, but this isn't the same situation as Chappaquiddick.The film made the salient point that politicians' personal lives have no bearing on their competency, but the filmmaker hammers the point home in such a way with his lack of subtlety and the loooooong ending that he renders his message ineffective.  And while the film claims to be feminist, it seems to take every opportunity to degrade and humiliate the Joan Allen character.  As a previous Amazon reviewer said, there's something in this film to offend everyone.  I give it two stars only for the cast (they all tried mightily to overcome their material) and the authenticity of the sets.",N/A

1250090,"If the acting in ""The Education of Charlie Banks"" had been better, it might have been a decent movie. Not great, but decent. As things stand, however, the combination of a dull, predictable plot and substandard acting make Charlie Banks a big ol' waste of time.The plot, such as it is, centers around Charlie Banks, played by Jesse Elsenberg who here plays the only kind of role that he ever plays, a nervous, nerdy nice kid perpetually afraid of getting swatted down like an insect. Charlie is enjoying the college life, having philosophical discussions with his friends while drinking beers, chasing women (unsuccessfully), when he and his roommate receive a visit from Mick (Jason Ritter), a charming sociopath that they know from earlier in the film.The meat of the film is supposed to revolve around Charlie's quasi-friendship with Mick, who is equal parts bully, mentor, and friend to Charlie. I won't ruin the ending but I will tell you that nothing happens that you don't expect. The writer attempts to prepare the audience for this lack of surprise by having the characters discuss The Great Gatsby and how, even the first time you read it, you already know how it's going to end, but that doesn't make it any less brilliant. In fact, they tell us, it makes it even better. It makes the ending seem all the more tragic because it's so inevitable.Well, Charlie Banks isn't The Great Gatsby and the formulaic ending (Charlie faces his fears, etc.) nicely caps off a film that is rich with stereotypes and cliches.The biggest problem with Charlie Banks, however, is the performance of Jason Ritter as the bully-friend-mentor, Mick. We are told repeatedly throughout the movie how charismatic Mick is, even though (or, perhaps, precisely because) he's such a violent guy. Jason Ritter doesn't come across as either dangerous or charismatic. Most of the time, he just looks goofy. He does hit people a few times, it's true, but that action does not spring naturally from his character; he simply does it because it's written in the script.The other lame performance in this movie is the love interest, Eva Amurri. Both Charlie and Mick are completely in love with this woman; I have no idea why. She's not particularly beautiful, she certainly never says or does anything even remotely interesting, and by the end of the film we still have no idea who she is or why she made the choices that she did.""The Education of Charlie Banks"" is a movie that will pound you over the head with its foreshadowing, symbolism, and attempts at ""deepness"" but ultimately it's just a big ol' bore.",Education Of Charlie Banks

Only 1 person can find out.. Jennifer Lopez!  She does this by entering his mind.The serial killer side of the movie is pretty uncreative and highly unmotivated. If you've ever read about or seen a movie about serial killers, you've seen it all before. You also get the idea that this guy is the guy all the other serial killers would make fun of and pick on, should all of the serial killers hang out together.  Too much time spent on why he is the way he is, which was lame and pointless.  Generic bleeding heart abused child story, where if it was true, 45% of us would be drowning and bleaching women like this guy is.Vince Vaughn's character actually says so much in the movie.  I think they probably cut out the one interesting part of the movie:  Why Vince Vaughn wasn't a  serial killer.Jennifer Lopez, as always, shouldn't really be acting in this movie.  The whole cyber-reality mind meld thing was pretty lame and unmotivated. Better examples of this can be found in older movies like Dreamscape and Brain Storm.

76928,"The only reason this has two stars is because the movie itself is so good. Otherwise, it's one star at best. First off, this is not a remastering. It looks no better than the DVD. In fact, the DVD may look better. You really see it in the credits type. In every other Blu-ray I have, they're crystal clear and sharp edged. Here, like in the DVD, they're very soft. The only other place I've seen type this soft is in the DVD of WKRP in Cincinnati, which was shot on videotape. In addition, the picture is frequently grainy and thin. Again, the DVD is the same way, but the Blu-Ray's higher definition makes the thin picture more obvious. The second problem is the extra features: Would you believe the Blu-ray doesn't have all the extras on the DVD? One of the documentaries from the DVD is missing.In short, if you have the DVD, don't bother with the Blu-ray. If you don't have either, get the DVD. It's cheaper, the picture is just as good (or you can say the Blu-ray is just as bad), and it's got more extras.",N/A
1071707,"While the film is undeniably assembled in an original and inventive manner, the movie is ultimately a failure for its lack of scares and its inability to cohesively tie all its narrative strings together.The movie tells the story of a family's dark tragedy, but presents their plight in two concurrent narratives: the past and the present. Nimbly jumping between both eras, the movie nicely splices together the parallel timelines to highlight their eerie similarities. The older version of the protagonist will enter a room and suddenly become her younger self. Certainly the editing and writing from that perspective elevate this film to a more artistic affair.Unfortunately, that's where the cleverness stops. Were this an indie art-house film, the nonlinear efforts might be more laudable. But as a horror film, it cannot salvage an otherwise weak outing. Despite the film's intelligent framing, the story proper devolves into trite and uninteresting cliches from the horror genre. Why the heroes are even embarking of their quest makes no sense either. Though the heroine looks directly at a camera to literally explain her motivations and mission, the &#34;experiment&#34; they conduct is extremely contrived and nonsensical, a poor excuse to drive the narrative. The final resolution is quite tame and unsatisfying too, infuriating those who invested themselves in getting to the truth of the mystery.A final affront comes from its misleading R-rating. As most commercial horror films are sanitized with a PG-13 version to draw the largest theater-going audience, this film is inexplicably rated R. However, the dearth of scares and fright does not warrant this more adult rating, as the film still feels like a watered-down PG-13. It's odd enough to almost feel like the marketers were intentionally mislabeling the film to draw in the more hardcore horror fans.",N/A

On paper, it looks like a winner and I expected to see something like a cross between Vacation and Van Wilder.  However, while you might expect this kind of movie to be loaded with side-splitting high jinks, I found the humor highly predictable and the characters flat at best.There are 3 main characters besides Parker and they are all pretty cliche.  First there is E.L. (Scott), as the obnoxious instigator.  There is Rubin Carver (Costanzo), as the eccentric pot-smoking A-student.  Of course, there is also the pathetic 98-pound straw man virgin Kyle Edwards (Qualls), who is the butt of everyone's jokes.  As the plot progresses: the pathetic virgin is deflowered; Carver smokes pot with an old man, and E.L. steals a short-bus and discovers the joys of prostate stimulation.  Like I said, it sounds good on paper, but every gag is telegraphed from a mile away.On the upside, while the humor is flat, the plot is kind of engaging.  The main reason that you will keep watching this movie is to find out whather or not Josh gets to Texas in time to intercept the videotape.  You will appreciate the consistency and linearity of the storyline, which is not diluted by the inclusion of too many subplots.  It really is a good road movie, if not a good comedy.On the downside (except for Scott and Smart) the actors in this flick have about as much screen presence as a rock.  While the characters might have been written as one-dimensional stereotypes, at least they could have played thier roles with some enthusiasm.Still, Road Trip is a fairly engaging movie but only because of the main plot.

This one was well-received, so I thought I'd check it out, especially since it has Sasha Baron Cohen in it, as well as John C Reilly, an actor I like very much. I'd say that of the three, John C Reilly is the funniest, with his good ole boy routine and his optimism that he can steal his best friend's hot wife and still remain buddies. Ha ha ha... Still, there are some good lines in the film like ""[The French} invented democracy, existentialism and the beejay."" Cohen, while not particularly funny here, does an interesting job portraying a ""happy"" Nascar driver. The gawks on commentators' faces when he introduces his husband are priceless. Sponsor's wife is lovin' the wall vibrations, that's pretty funny. Kenny Rogers scene is kind of funny. Nice use of a Monster Magnet song, ""Space Lord"", as well as AC/DC's ""TNT"", and Pat Benatar's ""We Belong"". Biggest car wreck ever.

Her boyfriend is in jail, turns out he is a serial killer. The woman starts going to AA meetings for her alcohol problem. She meets this seemingly nice guy at one of her AA meetings and they start dating. At the start of the movie we get to see the serial killer- the old boyfriend- doing his thing to his victim. I have to say that the guy who played the serial killer wasn't bad, in fact he may have been the highlight of the movie, he did pretty good as far as acting is concerned and overall personality of a serial killer. The rest of the cast didn't impress me. It felt as though some of them were hired right off the street to act in this movie. They didn't capture my interest.If I were to explain to you the whole plot of this movie and give away the ending you would probably say ""wow, that sounds good""- that's the problem- It sounds good but it isn't.So, we find out the boyfriend serial killer has escaped from jail is looking for her and now the old girlfriend needs a place to hide. She goes with this AA meeting guy to a cabin in the woods to hide out and then bam... Twist in the story. The ending sounds good on paper but on the screen it just didn't work for me. It may have been the actors hired for the roles, all of them who couldn't pull it off and make this interesting. The serial killer boyfriend did Okay though. Disappointing uninteresting ending and ended too soon despite the whole movie being somewhat boring. As in, the whole movie was boring to a degree then the ending you're left wanting more explanation.In a way it was somewhat cliche, but it did have a point to it I guess, though not enough to make me care or be impressed or make me want to watch again. I'd give it between 2 and 3 stars.",N/A
1482532,"First, I'd like to say that Van Damme portrayed an excellent villain.  I was surprised.  But he never fights.  Why the hell would I want to see Van Damme simply strutting around as a charismatic bad guy?  Fight!!!  Fight Lundgren.  Fight Jet Li.  Fight Terry Crews.  I watch this movie to see legendary match-ups with choreographed brilliance.  In this flop, the great Van Damme fights Stallone at the end for about 2 minutes.  What the hell is that?Lundgren got a chance to shine as a thespian as well, his expressions priceless, BUT . . . who wrote the dialogue to this movie?  The gods of action are forced to spew the stupidest, inane, worthless, pointless phrases!!!!!  It degrades our American action legends!The young sniper is a blatant plot tool.  And he fires a sniper rifle faster than a double-action revolver.  Impossible.  Who advised this film?The guys barely fight all of the goons sent their way.  Instead there is a ton of gunfire.  Spraying and praying.  Why the hell do I want to see these action stars shooting guns the whole damn time?Remember that epic battle between Lundgren and Li in Expendables?  Remember that match between Stone Cold and Stallone?  Nothing like that in this film.  Jet Li is the best in this film, but he is in the film for a couple minutes kicking major butt creatively.  Then he literally jumps out of the film.  Statham has a nice scene as a priest, murdering a few guys.  Terry Crews throws a few goons around creatively.  But there is one villain of note, who never fights any of the other Expendables one-on-one.  What good is that?  Don't you want to see Statham vs. Van Damme?  Don't you want to see Li vs. Van Damme?  They really dropped the ball.  Hey, try paying a few famous MMA guys to be Van Damme's henchman and pit them one on one vs the Expendables!This film has a few exciting violent scenes.  It has too little hand-to-hand combat.  It is a bullet-fest.  If I wanted that, I could watch a million mediocre films with nobody actors.This is a collection of the gods of action, and all we get is a silly shoot-out with impossible shots made.  If I wanted magic, I'd watch Harry Potter.And please do not mention the ridiculous and corny Chuck Norris scenes.  He shows up for NO REASON, rescues them with magic bullet sprays and missile launches out of thin air, has corny music, NEVER FIGHTS ANYONE, and has dialogue that sounds barely more useful than a blast of diarrhea.I am so disappointed with Expendables 2.  I love these stars.  Each one of them.  I respect their skills, and I KNOW they can kick major butt creatively with great spectacle.  Instead, I got a POORLY WRITTEN, plot-less, bore with child-like dialogue.  The actors are obviously trying to be entertaining.  They succeed in their expressions, body language, etc.  But the script gave them a tasty heap of dung to speak and a paper-thin unreasonable plot that nobody cares about.How can these guys come from excellent movies like the Transporter series, the Rambo series, Predator, the Die Hard series, and so on--and YET accept this poorly-written poop-fest with guns???????Imagine Bruce Willis trying to take on Van Damme or a drunken Lundgren?  How cool would that be to see?  Imagine Arnold and Stallone duking it out over some plot twist?  How awesome would that be?  Imagine Jet Li and Statham teaming up vs. a ton of guys.  How about Terry Crews brawling against Van Damme?  How about Chuck Norris fighting his way out of a paper bag, if he still can?We get none of that.  We get a glorified day at the gun range.  So, I swallow my love for these legends, and declare Expendables 2 barely mediocre entertainment.  And it hurts to say that.  The first one is way better than this one.  Van Damme was wasted.  All the talent was wasted.Expendables 3 now looks like a bad fart on the horizon.  I have little hope.",N/A
1082331,"When watching what the Masters of Horror collection has to offer, I really don't set the bar high. The thing they are trying to accompish it quite amazing, and the fact that I can buy the series for a good price is really beautiful. I honestly just need a few jumps to keep me guessing, maybe some laughs if they are going for comedy in the gore, and a little cohesiveness when it comes to the storyline. When I started watching Valerie on the Stairs I thought I was going to get that, too, but as I journeyed further into the abyss I began to realize that this wasn't one of the good or even the middle-ground episodes.No, it was really bad.Basically, we have the story of a writer who moves into this creepy place subbing as a haven for wannabe writers, and the writer begins hearing things that are, well, haunting. Soon after getting settled (if putting some of your stuff down and pecking at a typewriter getting settled) he sees something rather terrible/erotic; he hears some noise and goes to check on it and sees that there's a naked woman settled on the staircase outside just before she is dragged into the shadows by the hands of something bestial. If you haven't guessed, her name is Valerie, and the premise sounds enticing.For a few moments the movie is, too, and makes you think you've stuck gold.Sadly, like a child with a handful of pyrite, you soon realize that the cinema gods have duped you.The problem with the Valerie, aside from the fact that much of it is determined to be a softcore skin flick, is the fact that it doesn't maintain its edge. At first it starts out sharp, creepy even, but it looses that rather quickly and makes you wonder why. It honestly felt like it had been written well at first, almost like there was effort at the start, but then someone had gotten bored and had constructed the end on a bender. Strangely, it wasn't the acting or the effects or even the location that hurt the movie. It was simply the storyline and the direction that made this one a sure miss.The only people I would say that need to see this are perhaps horror wachers with lots of B-movie needs, hardcore fans of the Masters of Horror series, and perhaps people making a movie who need something to study on what ""not to do."" I would try to talk them out of it, too, but people have to do what people have to do. I guess I can understand that - I had to see it for myself and had the same type of warning.This is a not recommended and then some - sadly, I might add. For ten minutes I thought it would be soo much more.",Valerie On The Stairs
1679962,"After reading several reviews of The Invoking online, I, being a horror fan, duly watched the film. I must say that I was underwhelmed with the frights. The story can be a bit plodding and superficial in the beginning. The story is basically about a girl who inherits her aunt's home in a rural town. The place is never stated. She brings along her ex-boyfriend and and two other chums to check out her new digs. They are greeted by a strange war veteran who is, or is not, the caretaker of the home in question. What follows is a story of lost memory, apparent child abuse, and a killer/lover relationship with the main character. The flashbacks of lost memories tries to tell the viewer the back-story, however, the sudden flashes of familial abuse and bible verse spewing are trite and actually confuse the underlying, slow decay of the overall story.The ending is annoying at best. I predicted this so called plot twist early in the narrative. An astute viewer will likely also predict who really killed the leading characters aunt.",The Invoking

1082644,"Automaton Transfusion is an ultra low budget, gore-fest, zombie bash that has been made my some obvious zombie flick fanatics, but sadly any potential that it has gets squandered.  The story, for lack of a better word, revolves around a group of high school seniors that get caught in the middle of a zombie epidemic, and try to get out of town.  While story isn't really all that important in a pure zombie flick, it would be nice if we at least cared a little bit about the characters here.  We don't, at all, and instead just pray for their bloody demise.  It should also be noted that these zombies are of the running variety, which would mean that the action and scares would be aplenty.  Well, they aren't either, and the film as a whole just comes off as boring.  There are loads of gore effects, where most of Automaton Transfusion's budget seemed to go.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, as the gore effects are quite well done for a low budget flick, and are every bit as disgusting as any gorehound could hope for (one scene in particular will leave your jaw on the floor, if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about), and are reason enough to check out this flick.  Other than that though, there really isn't much else to Automaton Transfusion.  Maybe that's all fine and good for you, and if so then by all means check this out.  If you're looking for something that has a little bit of depth to it however (and doesn't have a grainy picture either), then Automaton Transfusion is definitely not for you.",Automaton Transfusion

419484,"Thanks to some bizarre copyright issues, the rights to the James Bond novel Thunderball were never completely held by the traditional Bond production team.Thus, another movie or movies could be made by another company with a screenplay based on Thunderball. Never Say Never Again was the result in 1983, with Sean Connery returning as James Bond 11 years after he had last played the role in Diamonds are Forever.Roger Moore's tenure as Bond was winding down in 1983, though that year's official Bond entry, Octopussy, still outgrossed this movie. Connery looks game but a little tired here, and the pacing seems off, and the movie overlong by about 20 minutes and one too many changes of locale. Klaus Maria Brandauer does make for a surprisingly sinister Bond villain, while Barbara Carrera and Kim Basinger do OK work as Bond girls evil and good, respectively.The tone shifts even more abruptly than usual for a Bond film, from parodic to serious and back again. That may partially be because of the screenwriter, Lorenzo Semple, who helped turn both the Batman tv series of the 1960's and the 1980 Flash Gordon film into smirking parodies of themselves. It's not quite Camp here, but it's close. M and the rest of the Bond hierarchy take the most severe beating, though Rowan Atkinson's first big-screen appearance, as an MI6 operative played solely for laughs, also grates. Bernie Casey is fine as CIA agent Felix Leiter, and actually has something to do other than supply exposition.The prime oddity of Never Say Never Again is that the first thirty minutes or so play like a dry run for the recent Bond movie Skyfall, as a rundown James Bond faces suspension and the Double-O program itself faces termination in the wake of political changes. An historical oddity, Never Say Never Again also acts as a weird psychological test -- viewing a James Bond movie without the familiar soundtrack never feels entirely comfortable. That the score for this movie, and the title song, are both unremittingly terrible doesn't help things.",Never Say Never Again VHS
125786,"Huh? What is this muddled piece of recycled Saturday matinee hutzpah director Frank ""wanna-be-Spielberg"" Marshall has tortured his unfortunate victims with? I know Hollywood is driven by an avaricious legion of money-grubbers ready to foist any plot-poor m&eacute;lange on an unsuspecting audience, but this must be the pinnacle of impudence!Anyway, this liberally adapted aberration of Michael Crichton's best selling novel follows an expedition into the Varunga region of the Congo by a disparate group of adventurers, each with their own agenda. We have the good boy primatologist (Dylan Walsh) who only wants to return Amy - a silverback gorilla with the ability to speak, via a computerized sign language device - to her jungle abode (I am feeling all warm and fuzzy). We have the high-tech gadget wielding Dr. Karen Ross (Laura Linney), searching for a lost team of diamond-hunters from her communications company. We have the Great ""White"" Hunter (Ernie Hudson), who, despite being black, manages to survive a Hollywood film all the way through the closing credits! Then there is Herkermer Homolka (say that five times fast), a paltering Romanian in search of King Solomon's Mines when he should be in search of a good face-lift. Played by Tim Curry, Homolka distorts his face into ungodly deformations that would make Jim Carry jealous! The clincher is when Curry says ""Every word of it was absooooluuuutely true."" Do not even get me started on his accent! Oh, by the way, our heroes run into some bloodthirsty, person-in-a-suit, killer gorillas along the way.As bad as ""Congo"" was, I still had fun watching the mishmash of cast members like the odd-looking Grant Heslov (he is always in these kinds of films), Joe Don Baker (reprising his role of a tough redneck for the umpteenth time), and the ever amusing, comic book hero-visaged Bruce Campbell! The acting and dialogue is embarrassing; my face was blushing for the actors. Director Frank Marshall may be thought of as a poor man's Steven Spielberg, but in this case, he is a dead man's Steven Spielberg. The pace of the film is non-existent, and there are absolutely no surprises to compensate for John Patrick Shannley's inane screenplay. Only lush African scenery and Jerry Goldsmith's crackerjack score deliver this turkey from the bowels of a one-star rating. By the time you reach the ""big climax"" (considering you have not pressed the eject button by this point), you are left wandering just what was the point - to use up a few excess rounds of prop ammunition, maybe? The celluloid that was wasted on this film could have been used to make a good nature film about REAL gorillas. Heck, gorillas themselves could have made a better a film!

622950,"At one time, around half a century ago, the Western was the dominant genre in film; eventually, however, it got tired and formulaic and is now a minor field, with only one or two movies a year often appearing.  Nowadays, it is the serial killer movie that is one of the dominant genres, but like the Western, it is almost played out, as Taking Lives amply shows.While not the worst in this category, Taking Lives is a mediocre movie which offers little worthwhile.  Sure, there are a couple moments that make you jump, but this is no measure of a quality movie; any film can startle you with a sudden noise.  Instead, the viewer is subject to a tired story about a mysterious killer who takes over the identities of his victims.  It's a been-there-done-that sort of movie.  Even the makers of the movie seem aware of the movie's tediousness and seem to provide a prolonged sex scene with Angelina Jolie only as a reward to those able to stick with the film past the halfway point.After the sex scene, what has been a so-so movie takes a turn for the worst, with absurdities and poor plot twists.

1362017,"""The Evil"" is a decent haunted house movie starring one of my favorite actors ever, Richard Crenna.  Crenna is money as usual, and the rest of the case was passable as well.  It could be said that the acting actually saves the movie in a way.  With lesser actors, the movie could have been a disaster.  The story is about a group of doctors who want to set up a drug rehabilitation center in an old and supposedly haunted building.  Strange things start happening early on in the movie, and things get progressively worse in a hurry for the unsuspecting guests.While ""The Evil"" is atmospheric and does a decent job of establishing an overall scary mood, the ""The Evil"" just is not all that it could be.  In short, its execution is severely flawed and lacking in creativity while the movie is also quite short on style.  Haunted house movies are very difficult to pull off because the mood is so difficult to establish, but the hardest part is the manifestations of the horror, and ""The Evil"" fails here as well.  While a reasonably decent haunted house movie especially for the type, ""The Evil"" still has its warts and is definitely an overrated movie given these high reviews.

831547,"I loved watching ""Unsolved Mysteries"" back in its TV heyday.  But, this ""Miracles"" edition is just too uncomfortable to sit through.  These stories on ""Miracles"" are more for the weak-minded, naive, religious-types, than those with reasonable common sense.  Don't get me wrong.  I do believe in God.  Absolutely!  God answers my questions because he's granted me the ability to process realities to know what my answers will be.  I am fortunate to have things go my way.  But, I do work for it, I don't expect anyone to just provide for me.  I'm sure God appreciates that I make my own effort to excel positively, as I do.I really don't believe that there are times when God will choose to intervene a pending tragedy, when so many times, He will not.  Remember the Tsunami, just after Christmas, in a heavily Christian environment?  Yeah right, God was there for them, wasn't He?  Fate is nothing more than the luck of the moment.  I'm sure God will say that we did something to our earth and caused this to happen, so it IS our fault.I don't go around making myself sound ignorant by saying: ""God has put his hand into the intervention of this particular tragedy of which we have been spared"".  Give me a break!  I'm sure, in most of these questionable stories on this ""Miracles"" collection, there is a scientific explanation for what has happened.  Or, they are just well crafted hoaxes.  I wouldn't doubt that there could be desperate church parishioners trying to create an illusion of a godly presence in their church just to drum up some attention.If one person said that a ""miracle"" happened, we'd think he or she was crazy, but if 3 or more people say that a ""miracle"" happened, that now makes it more possibly true?  If 5 or more people say so, then it must be a fact!I think some people give up their investigations too early, and therefore want to comfort themselves by saying that God did this.  God might even say: ""Hell, I had nothing to do with that! People are sure quick to give in to the fantasy of the fabricated power of prayer.""These tabloid-worthy stories of the ""Miracles"" collection somewhat reduces the integrity of the show's appeal to me.  I'm glad this religious crap was separated from the others so that I can enjoy some of the more reasonable tangibility of the other stories.We all have a conscience.  This is what controls our decisions to do good or bad.  Man invented something as to create an alternative to interpret how we deal with our conscience.  And he called it ""religion"".  And man learned how to make money from this cash-cow called religion. God is just another entity of commercialism.  I think we really did forget what Christmas is all about.  Today, Christmas is about Santa Claus and sales figures to compare to sales of the previous years, and Easter is about Easter bunnies and Easter eggs.  Good Friday, to some people, is just some great long three hour lunch hour at the bar.Man learned that he could use religion to take advantage of people.  The rich and the poor.  Yes, especially  the Poor!!  People who have next to nothing, who give what they can to a church or religious entity that already has so much more than them.  I believe God and I both kick back and laugh at that.There are many facets of religion, and they all expect you to make a sacrifice (usually your money), to show your faith.  Because, man knows that some people are weak and insecure, so they need something to believe in because they don't really believe in themselves. And religious parents instill this insecurity into their children so they'll be messed up for life too (unless they start to learn to process common sense early enough in their life).The church says that you'll be rewarded in the end.  Yeah, the rear end, I'm sure.  Get out your wallets, people!I really doubt that I will be buying ""Unsolved Mysteries: Miracles, Volume Two"".

1214689,"**1/2Over the course of the last few decades, war movies have become so unflinchingly brutal and authentic in their depiction of life on the battlefield that they've become all but impossible to sit through - and I say this as a compliment, not as a denigration.  They SHOULD be impossible to sit through.  This IS war we're talking about after all.That being said, it should also be pointed out that ""The Miracle at St. Anna"" - a highly fictionalized account of an actual event - devotes only a minimal amount of time to carnage and bloodshed as it unfolds its story of four African-American soldiers (Laz Alonso, Derek Luke, Michael Ealy and Omar Benson Miller) trapped behind enemy lines in Italy during the closing days of WW II.  The film recounts their experiences with sympathetic villagers, anti-Fascist partisan fighters, Nazi soldiers (of both good and bad stripe), an orphaned boy they take under their wing and, of course, the requisite beautiful Italian peasant girl (Valentina Cervi) who wears tight sweaters and has a steamy encounter with one of the men.This latest work by Spike Lee certainly has its heart in the right place and there are scenes of undeniable intensity and power where he once again demonstrates his bona fides as a director of genuine vision and power (the brutal massacre of a group of unarmed villagers at the hands of the Nazis - the one truly nonfiction moment in the story - is the emotional high point of the movie).Yet, the movie, as a whole, adds up to much less than the sum of its parts, a victim of both overreaching and over-length (the movie takes a full two hours and 40 minutes to tell its story).  Interestingly, the screenplay by James McBride (based on his novel) suffers from trying to do too much and too little at one and the same time.  At some points, it seems as if he is doing his best to throw everything but the kitchen sink into the narrative mix, while, at others, the movie feels thin and underdeveloped, with the characters stuck for long stretches of time in a storyline that doesn`t seem to be going anywhere all that interesting or dramatic.  The diffuse and meandering plot drains the film of much of its narrative and emotional energy, and the movie is further hampered by the use of an uninteresting murder subplot - set in the 1980s - as an all too conventional framing device for the main story.  It is in these scenes, in particular, where Lee's grand opera style of filmmaking - bolstered by Terence Blanchard's melodramatic score - most threatens to fall over the edge into pretentiousness.  Moreover, the bathos and low comedy that frequently creep into the writing, as well as the fact that the four men seem more like clearly differentiated ""types"" than fully-rounded human beings, serve to undercut the generally fine performances by a large and gifted cast.Apart from the gripping war-is-hell scenes, ""The Miracle at St Anna"" is at its best when it's focusing on the bitter irony of men being called upon to do their patriotic duty of fighting and dying in a foreign land - all for a country that forces them to serve in black-only units in the field and to eat in segregated diners back home.  One of the characters even confesses, at one point, that he feels more ""free"" and accepted in Italy than he does in the United States.There's probably a first-rate two-hour-long movie buried somewhere in the midst of ""The Miracle at St. Anna.""  A pity Lee and McBride weren't able to fully ferret it out.",Miracle at St Anna

The only person i liked in this movie was Alva (played by Maria Conchita Alonso).Nicholas Cage has definitely changed his voice because when it was in here and also in Valley Girl and Peggy Sue Got Married it was more higher pitched, now when you see him in a movie it's more deeper. And he does a terrible accent in this movie. His acting has gotten better because in here it's just lousy. He plays crazy well but in here it could have been better.He is a man named Peter Loew who is a publishing executive and he's bit by a vampire (or so he thinks) one night while he takes this woman Rachel (played by Jennifer Beals) home to his apartment for what he thinks will be casual sex, but while they are making out on his bed she bites him on the neck and then basically through out the film he terrorizes Alva when he's at work and he basically goes nuts. Rachel is not even real, she's a figment of his imagination. He finally gets to the point where he truly believes he's a vampire so he goes to a store and buys cheap fangs. Hmmm, okay. Then he goes in a park and catches a pigeon, takes it back to his apartment and eats it. It doesn't get better from there.Definitely not something i would want to watch again.",N/A

Ok, so you have read the book..... being a fan, I must admit it was nice to actually see actors with names I know so well and yes, there are some dramatic moments but this film fails in conveying the underlying evil, thought, policies that have such good intentions and wind up killing the goose that lays the golden egg.

I watched it in 3D and even that was disappointing.  The story was re-told in a way that would have embarrassed Christopher Reeve if he were still around.  Henry Cavill, although chiseled etc., had a constant dumbfounded look on his face like he just didn't understand why the chicken had to get to the other side.  Russell Crowe was the best part of this movie hands down and his presence throughout the film granted the second star in my rating.  Kristen/Amy Bell/Stewart/Adams or whatever it is, was absolutely useless for this role and a good actress that should stick to Oscar caliber films.  These guys going around re-making superhero films should get their act together and stop pretending that they're too cool for school by cutting up the story.

Now, that may be forgivable, but...Using five-star ""Mulan"" as the standard, ""Quest for Camelot"" lacks quality in so many areas.  The animation itself is poorer, the story rather less uplifting, the soundtrack more raw.

Which is sad, because he and Churchill (the dog) had more personality than most of the human cast!I will say that this movie was far sadder and more depressing than I would have imagined.  Those looking for feel-good Disney fluff should turn away now.  There's not a whole lot of happy in this movie.  It has a very dark, depressing feel to it despite some of the more lighthearted moments (mostly starring Crusoe and Churchill).

538527,"** 1/2 I can certainly understand why ""Spy Kids"" has been such an enormous hit with children.  What is childhood fantasy, after all, but an attempt by essentially powerless youngsters to bring a little order to their world, to show themselves and the adults around them that they too are good for something - even if it's only saving the world from the forces of evil before it's time to come in to face chores, homework and bedtime.  Of course, children merely mimic the fantasies adults themselves indulge in - utilizing the same set of conventions that serve as the template for virtually all action/adventure films that have featured heroes on the order of James Bond, Rambo, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in his various fictional guises.  In many ways, the films featuring those characters demonstrate that many of us have still not outgrown the simplistic view of the world that fuels our earliest fantasies.  By making the heroes of this film specifically children, ""Spy Kids"" fulfills that need children have to feel that they too can be an active part of a power-conferring fantasy rather than just the passive observers they usually end up being in a real world controlled by adult concepts and adult rules.Fair enough.  What I don't understand, though, is why adults seem to be so enamored of ""Spy Kids,"" which, for all its hullabaloo and hubbub, is really little more than a juvenile version of the same spy spoof nonsense that has been a staple of filmmaking since the 1960's (nicely resurrected by the ""Austin Powers"" films a few years back).  Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino star as Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, two dashing former spies who have traded in the exciting world of field espionage for less glamorous ""desk jobs"" in the spy organization so that they can raise their two children, Carmen and Juni, in a more normal, less hectic and less dangerous environment.  Carmen and Juni, unaware of their parents' past, look upon them as two hopelessly nerdy representatives of an ""uncool"" older generation.  When Gregorio and Ingrid decide, after nine years out of commission, to get back into the secret agent business, they discover that some of their espionage skills have become a little rusty and they are instantly caught and imprisoned by a mad children's show producer bent on creating a race of indestructible children robots.  When Carmen and Juni discover the truth of their parents' identities and predicament, the two youngsters set off on a mission to singlehandedly rescue them from a fate worse than death.One of the problems with ""Spy Kids"" is that it seems to mistake frenetic activity for humor and wit.  Through long stretches of the film, we are being hurtled through space in one imaginary vehicle after another as the children search desperately for their kidnapped parents.  There is, moreover, an awful lot of frantic running around by the various characters, but the result is, oddly, not excitement but rather tedium.  Because writer/director Robert Rodriguez has failed to provide any truly clever dialogue, he has been forced to rely far too heavily on the special effects to carry the day.  The result is that we are never particularly captivated by the antics either of the children or of the parents, who, I hasten to note, actually spend most of their time off screen.  When they are on screen, they often come across as arch, self conscious and cutesy, rather than smooth, suave and witty.  Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara, as the two children, are unremarkable but relatively likable screen presences.  At least they are not as cloying as their parents.The art director, set decorator and production designer deserve mention for their superb work in creating a never-never land world caught somewhere between reality and fantasy, perfectly suitable for a film built on childhood imaginings.  It's too bad that the screenplay fails to consistently match that level of creativity.  Stand by for the inevitable sequel!",N/A

909503,"I enjoy romantic comedies a lot, and rented this with high hopes.  Debra Messing hires Dermot Mulroney from an escort service as her date to her sister's wedding, and to show off how well off she is to her cynical family.  Predictably, the business relationship becomes more romantic, and the two fall in love.The premise could have worked, if it weren't for a few glaring problems.  One, you don't really feel you know the main characters at all; they are just cliched romantic comedy prototypes, meaning you never really know why the two leads fall for each other.  Two, him being an escort doesn't really add anything to the plot, even though the movie thinks it does.  Three, none of the characters come across very likeable.  Four, Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney have no chemistry at all.  You don't really care if the two get together, or even want them to, since they are rather cold to each other for most of the movie.If only one problem could be fixed, I'd choose the chemistry factor.  That could easily be fixed by replacing one of the actors.  Maybe Julia Roberts for Debra Messing, since it's fairly obvious this movie was probably proposed as a vehicle for her, or anyone else to be the Dermot Mulroney character, since he's really given nothing to do but be goodlooking.  No good romance exists without the chemistry.However, if you are looking for a simple diversion to kill 90 minutes, this movie could be okay.  If not, rent/watch Pretty Woman instead, which is more or less the same premise, but actually makes you care about the characters.",N/A

Boy, it turns out that I am dead wrong. It's not them really. Christmas with the Kranks is basically watching Christmas in Nazi Germany.

I never even got the answer from Christmas with the Kranks to the question why the daughter was coming back from Peace Corps mission. You know, that mission is a two-year thing. Looking at that girl, I have to be in a disbelief. There is not a lot of humor found in Christmas with the Kranks, but of course, plenty of nauseous feeling and boredom helped to set in. Christmas with the Kranks is a totally unappreciative picture that takes a cheap shot of stealing the adorable and so fine majestic spirit of Christmas. Okay...let us pause here. Exactly what kind of people the picture focuses on? I see a family that spends $6,100 on Christmas alone with a husband who is probably a partner on a law firm and big houses along with other big houses filled with predominately white Anglo Saxon Protestants. I suspect the audience for this picture is very limited. On comedic level, Christmas with the Kranks doesn't par up well with National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

Zoolander is just stupid and perhaps the worst Ben Stiller movie ever.Stiller stars at Derek Zoolander, vaucous male model who is recruited by fashion industry thugs to kill the prime minter of Malaysia, because he plans to end child labor.  Helping him in this effort is an equally vapid model, Hansel (Owen Wilson who usually gets much better roles than this) and Matilda, a crusading reporter (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor who will make you yearn for her Brady Bunch movie roles).  Of the supporting players,  Jerry Stiller is absolutley horrible, badly acting as the owner of a modleing agency.  Stiller's mom Ann Meara is even in this, throwing an egg at a fashion desinger.  If only we had the same opportunity.The story really isan't about anything, it is a collection of jokes and bits that are mostly unfunny.  One scene in Hansel's pad, is excrutiatingly long.

1287785,"While there are warm scenes between Darwin and his daughter Anne and also, of course, between Darwin and his wife, the movie as a whole has a somber tenor about it.  The tone of the film is necessarily sad because of the argument being made that the existence of evil argues against God's existence, certainly an age-old argument.  To make the point there is a lot of suffering shown:  by Darwin, his daughter, and by certain creatures that are highlighted.  In making this argument the film-makers do not take into consideration how the fall of man that we read about in Genesis brought death upon all of creation.Darwin as played by Paul Bettany suffers greatly from physical and emotional illness (just as Darwin did) and he is mentally tormented by what he sees as purposeless in nature and the needless destruction of animal life: in the film Darwin mentions the trout, for example, producing myriads of offspring which are then eaten by other animals.There is some historical inaccuracy that I was able to detect.  The major impetus for Darwin writing his seminal book was not so much Huxley, but Darwin's receiving a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace who also conceived the theory of evolution.  Wallace, a spiritist, had received the theory in a vision.  Darwin's colleagues such as Thomas Huxley urged Darwin to write his book so that he would be given sole credit for the theory.  The film makes the reason for the writing of the Origin of Species a moral argument coming from Huxley and agreed upon by Darwin when really it was  the threat from Wallace that was the reason.Christianity is rather misrepresented by the local village pastor who is cruel and unreasonable to Anne and in the end abandons Darwin.  This is an unfortunate representation of Christianity but it helps the argument of the film.  During Darwin's lifetime there were very sincere and Godly Christians who were providing housing, food, and clothing in Bristol and in London.  Thousands of orphans were helped.  This was only a small part of what was happening in Christianity.  It is also true that there were men taking positions as country vicars who cared more for a respectable position and  their hobbies than the souls of men,  but, as I say, there was much more to the picture than what they represented.Also, Darwin's theory was not opposed only by the religious, a point made by Huxley in the movie.  It was also opposed by reputable scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Gregor Mendel to name a few.  Also, many who were religious, including many clergy,  jumped on the Darwinian bandwagon.  Darwin's theory was an excuse to disregard the Bible, or, at the least, not regard it as an authority.  This is the reason why in many religious circles today, the Bible is considered to be only myth or poetry.Many of us can relate, I am sure, to Darwin's struggle (at least to some extent) with the existence of evil and the seeming lack of purpose of things.  For many of us, when we came to know Jesus Christ, we looked at God's creation quite differently and could understand the purpose of things.  We could also appreciate the effect that the fall of man has had upon the creation.  But we can watch this film and realize that before we were Christians we similarly did not appreciate God for who He is and His creation for what it is.",Creation anglais

I didn't see the series on TV but the reviewer stated that the first episodes were contained in Set Five.  I am 2/5ths of the way through this boxed set and I am baffled by the great reviews that this series has garnered.These two first episodes present some of the nastiest persons that it has ever been my misfortune to encounter. Life is way too short to spend it with people who are so mean-spirited.  First of all, Inspector Barnaby is constantly and unnecessarily sarcastic to his young Sargeant.  There is no reason for this except for unkindness of spirit.  Secondly, in these two episodes everyone sneers at everyone else.  Even if there were no other faults in these episodes who with a healthy mind would want to spend time with these really unpleasant people.  But there are many other things wrong. The killer(s) turn out to be two self-absorbed young people - brother and sister - who have been having an incestuous relationshiop since they were teens and who killed in order to make way for the sister to marry a widower whom they then plan to kill for his money.  There is a hideous mother-and-son blackmailing duo who are grotesque and sickening in their relationship.  But all these nasty people, unpleasant as they are, pale in comparison to those in Episode Two.In Episode Two we have sexual abuse of a young boy by his father, patricide, transvestites and the sort of teenagers that reminded me of Lord of the Flies.  A high school drama club decides to entice their drama teacher to have a sexual relationship with one of the fifteen-year-old girls, photographs him and then, as a group, sends him the photos and tries to blackmail him for money.  When he declines to pay these little monsters post the pictures on the village green so that the whole town can see them.  And, as usual, everyone is sneering at everyone else all of the time.Except for Inspector Barnaby's wife and daughter there doesn't seem to be a single normal human being in these first two episodes and I am really at a loss to understand the fulsome praise that this series has received.  If one wants to see life in an English village I'll take Miss Marple every time.  There are unusual characters to be sure but the overriding miasma of plain mastiness and meanness that I've encountered in Midsomer Murders is entirely absent in the Agatha Christie characters as developed in Miss Marple and in Hercule Poirot.I will watch the next three episodes because I bought them but I am fearful of what horrors next lie in store.

1570113,"Have not see Jane Bigalow's film ""Zero Dark Thirty"" but I have read ""No Easy Day"" and, while I'm no SEAL Operator (military historian who teaches a course at Lake Region, it doesn't take one to realize several flaws in a military film or see it for what it is.Before I go into any real analysis let me just say that I am NOT a republican.  I, personally, find both parties to be corrupt, out of touch, apathetic to anything/anyone but the security of their own jobs, and other negative phases, metaphors, and adjectives involving several species of leeches.  I hate politicians, period, regardless of political affiliation.Now that THAT is out my system, let us begin.While I love just about any production shown on National Geographic (NATGEO) given their high production value and (usually) strong sense of objectivity, SEAL Team Six came off as a political commercial or pat on the back for President Barrack Obama.  The film dedicates its first ten minutes to barely mention information obtained from a detainee at Guantanamo Bay in 2002 and montages its way to 2010 with LOTS of clips showing President Obama defending his position on hunting for Osama Bin Laden while, curiously, only republican politicians slammed his position.This, the film could have done without and supplemented it with Presidents Bush and Obama talking about an ongoing hunt for Bin Laden or, God forbid, NOT bring in politics at all.  This would have made the first part of the film easier to be taken seriously as it blatantly came across as a political ad... especially given it's on-air release date of November 4th.  However, it didn't end there as the film kept reverting back to the political side showing Obama and Clinton watching a live-feed of the raid when no such thing happened (or so it was reported).  While many would see this as awesome given their political affiliation, it alienates others and, therefor, is not as appealing to the general audience.On to the film itself.  I could tell that the production crew were deeply in love with GoPro cameras as they were featured heavily and much of the on-screen footage came from GoPros.  BTW: when you're showing any camcorder footage as on-screen with the dates in the corner, be sure to keep it within continuity as one scene had 1-31-2011 dated in the corner and immediately cuts to a scene in Hampton Virginia with the dates October 28, 2010 front and center.  Either way, the constant helmet cams and GoPros, while fascinating, were used too much and were used to make the action seem faster when it wasn't.My next criticism involves the format of the film itself.  It self-labels itself as a docudrama, a highly dramatized documentary of sorts even though it's not.  SEAL Team Six presents this with a flashback format as the operators and players are detailing their experiences and feelings after the fact.  Never was really fond of that style as it takes away surprise as well as any riveting sense of excitement: it just goes on and on.  Indeed, SEAL Team Six is, for a lack of a better SAT term that critics love to use, boring.  While there was a little 'excitement' as an old school SEAL butts heads with a younger one he has to take orders from, there was little else.I tried to wait until the end raid and noticed several things that directly contradicted ""Mark Owen's"" account in ""No Easy Day.""  The raid on Bin Laden's compound was portrayed as considerably more... loud than the silent raid depicted in the book.  Granted the scene was still lackluster and failed to keep me on the edge but maybe the trick is keeping the audience on the edge by suspense, not action.  The filmmakers could have have accomplished as much by keeping it suspenseful thus making the film more enjoyable and keeping true with the historical accuracy.Next is the acting and in a word; bland.  While William Fitchner is a grossly under appreciated actor, the rest of the cast did not contribute anything decent.  They just read lines and the story went on.  Oh yeah, they had a rapper from MTV... applause?  Didn't think so.SEAL Team Six could have been a really good film as the production value was high but the story is a good one but for a myriad of reasons it just fell short.  It wasn't exciting, well acted, and tried too hard to push Obama in the spotlight, which is a total turnoff regardless of who the president is.  I don't care of Ronald Reagan comes back from the dead, sticks his head out of the UH-60 Blackhawk to remind the operators to ""Win one for the Gippur!""  It totally turned me off as did the rest of the film.I'm going to try and redeem my time by going to see Zero Dark Thirty tomorrow.  Hopefully, I won't contemplate seppuku afterwards for a double-whamey.",N/A

Yes, there is a lot of blood and gore, but it's nothing I haven't seen before, and what I assume was supposed to be the most visceral moment in the film came across as somewhat comical to me.  I also found it somewhat awkward that the filmmakers would suddenly decide to cram a storyline in to the film with about fifteen minutes to go.  It's as if they set out to make a film in search of a plot but chickened out at the last minute.  I guess they did achieve their goal of making a zombie film that starts out kicking it hardcore and keeps the blood flowing until the very end, but it came at the expense of both story and character development.  I only liked one character in the whole movie, and he ultimately let me down by going squirrelly on me.  As for the ending, I have to be blunt and say it totally sucked - a true WTF moment, and not in a good way.This film was reportedly shot in nine days at a cost of just thirty thousand dollars.  That being the case, the gory special effects are impressive.  It's actually too much of a good thing, though, because all the pointless bloodshed eventually ends up boring the experienced horror movie fan.  Even the title bugs me because I have no idea what it is referring to.  Maybe I would have found out if I had bothered to watch the movie again with the director/producer commentary, but I really had no desire to sit through this nonsense a second time.

367055,"Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" is certainly quite imaginitive, but it is not a horror film classic by any means whatsoever.  As I watched, I thought to myself that this movie is very radical and way out of the ordinary and that is probably why people like it so much.  Frankly, I did not find the cenobytes to be that scary (interesting, yes, but not scary) or Frank in his bloody flesh form.The movie kept my interest because I wanted to see how it would end, so for that part, I'll give it a 2.5 STAR rating, but as an overall horror flick, I wasn't that impressed.  That being said, it was suspenseful and the story is somewhat interesting and entertaining to a certain degree.  The acting is actually pretty good and the directing is average, but the storyline isn't that compelling as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned.The movie starts out with a man named Frank, who is quite evil (he comes off as more evil than the Cenobytes to me) and very sensual who buys a puzzle box that supposedly contains the secret pleasures and pain of Hell which are obviously closely related.  I sincerely doubt there is any pleasure in Hell, but if you are evil maybe you can get some sick form of pleasure from it.  Anyway, the Cenobytes are released from the box by Frank.  The Cenobytes introduce Frank to incredible torture and pain that is of a supernatural nature.  The leader of the Cenobytes named ""Pinhead"" orchestrates such torture upon Frank and anyone else who dares to fiddle with that box.  I should say that I found all of the Cenobytes to be interesting and very imaginative.  My favorite one was the whose teeth were always chattering.  I thought he was funny.However, Frank discovers that he can actually regain human form if he is given enough blood and flesh from the living.  His former adulteress procures men that she kills in order to provide this blood to Frank and slowly but surely he regains this human form.  However, the daughter of the adulteress's husband informs the Cenobytes that Frank is escaping their clutches and she leads Frank back to them so that they can take him back to Hell where he belongs.  The young lady discovers that the Cenobytes want her as well, but she is able to manipulate the box to thwart any of their evil advances.The ending of this movie is pretty lame in my opinion as some demon flies off with the box.  While Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser"" is quite imaginitive and entertaining to some degree, it is also plenty gross and disgusting as the movie indulges itself with inordinate amounts of gore which the film obviously relies very heavily upon in order to attain a horror-like quality.  To me, this is not scary, but it is gross.  I do like blood and gore when it is used correctly to accentuate the horror, but I believe that blood and gore are a tool which should be incidental to the story and atmosphere of the movie.  With ""Hellraiser"", the blood and gore overshadows the story to some degree.  I understand that a certain amount of gore was necessary to the movie's story, but when the gore overshadows the story, I think the movie becomes more of a display of gore for the sake of gore.  In other words, it takes more than imagination and gore to be a great horror movie, and Clive Barker fails to create the ever elusive classic horror experience in ""Hellraiser"".Given the criticisms of this movie, I still recommend renting ""Hellraiser"" just to be able to have said that you have watched it if nothing else, but don't expect it to live up to the raving reviews it has received on Amazon because it simply isn't that scary, nor is it great, and I feel very confident that sophisticated horror movie fans will see exactly what I mean when they watch it.  After having read these glowing reviews, I can honestly say that I was disappointed with ""Hellraiser"".  2.5 STARS for ""Hellraiser"" for the fact that it is a decent (but flawed) horror movie, imaginative and entertaining to some extent.  However, for the reasons mentioned herein, I would conclude by saying that I do not think that ""Hellraiser"" is a great horror movie or a classic horror movie by any stretch of the imagination.",N/A

Excuse me, but I wanted to see a movie and all I have is like putting some cameras in a Broadway theatre to watch the full entire version of the musical.Moreover, what we see in this ""film"" are not actors themselves.

Another thing is: why the frontier between the ugly and the pretty is so wide? No twist is possible.Music: perfect. Scenario: brilliant. Make-up and custome design: alright. All static matters are superior. But the film is very poor in performance, development and plot. In fact I don't like the original story.

A big, bad corporation bought out the owners of the radio station and was going to turn the theater into a parking lot.  The movie is set on the evening of the show's final running.This movie was the most random, mish mash of unfunny, unrelated story lines.  There's a mysterious white trench-coated woman, attempts at flatulence humor, dopey wannabe cowboys and an overdramatic spurned lover.  With such a high-powered cast, one would think they could at least make it slighly entertaining on the power of their acting abilities alone.

20031,"Despite having a fantastic cast and spot-on wardrobe, set decoration and cinematography, THE END OF THE AFFAIR flounders because it tries so hard to be a morality play, it forgets to give us interesting characters.  Each of  the three leads is locked by their respective world views into senses of  propriety that largely prevent them from communicating.  They all believe  they are acting in the right way, according to their own system of beliefs,  and so feel no need to explain their actions.  Consequently, very little  actually *happens* in the film.  It is a film ultimately about reactions.  And that's fine stuff for a novel, like the Graham Greene basis for the  screenplay, but it hardly makes for a satisfying night at the movies.It's made particularly unsatisfying because we're never really  introduced to the characters.  We don't know why Julianne Moore's character  married Stephen Rae's.  And we need to know. There's certainly nothing in  the present of their relationship which explains why they would have  married.  They seem to have nothing in common, and Stephen Rea acts so  completely joyless throughout, it's hard to see why they'd even be good  friends.  We likewise don't see the root of Ralph Fiennes' atheism, nor  indeed Julianne Moore's Christianity.To be sure, this is somewhat  faithful to the novel, which has all events transpiring before the eyes of  Fiennes' character, who doubles as the story's narrator.  Given that, it  makes sense that there would be a certain incompleteness of vision about  the other characters.  But the dearth of exposition in this film is far  more than can be explained by narrative perspective.  It's simply missing,  and there's no good  reason for that.Without that vital character  background, we don't care about them--and we're certainly unimpressed by  the moral their story aims to teach.  In fact, the groundwork laid for that  conclusion is so sparse, and the conclusion itself so controversial, that  we're left feeling as if the filmmakers have committed a form of gratuitous  blasphemy.(DVD NOTES: This product has an above average collection of  extras, including two audio commentaries, a making-of featurette and an  isolated music score.  The featurette is rather forgettable, but the audio  commentaries are significant and interesting-more engrossing than the film  itself.IMPORTANT NOTE:  There's a double-feature version of this product  that has both the original film and this remake on it.  It's more  expensive, but worth it.)",N/A

641694,"This movie was much less than I expected, most importantly because the characters were flat and hard to care about.By the time Murrow took on McCarthy, many peoples' lives had been affected by the senator's tactics and any of those stories would have done more to illuminate the consequences of a climate of extreme terror than this dry, somewhat monotonous film. Murrow stands in stark relief as the only brave man willing to stand up to McCarthy, juxtaposed with a couple and a fellow journalist who stand in for ""ordinary people"" (fearful, unable to cope with the pressure).If you are looking for a civics lesson and a morality tale of the bravery of the lone hero, you'll like this movie. If you are looking for emotional intensity or being lost in a story, you will not find it here.This movie is contemptuous of television for having failed its potential as a source of information and education for the American people - more like a newspaper.

1028004,"I wanted to love M. Night Shyamalan's film, Lady in the Water. Moving in a different direction from his trademark style as evidenced by films like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and The Village, Shyamalan delivers a fairytale about an apartment superintendent who rescues a young woman in the complex's swimming pool. With the help of some of the other tenants, he must uncover information about her and her world in order to help her return home. While based on his book of the same name, the movie is wholly original introducing a world of characters not in the book.Paul Giamatti, who does a wonderful job as the superintendent who is more than he seems, leads the cast. Tragedy has led his character to distance himself from others, observing the tenants of his world without involvement. Discovering the young woman, revealed to be a character from a fairytale called a Narf, reasserts his confidence and starts a process of reconnection to others beginning with the tenants he recruits to help him with his charge.Bryce Dallas Howard plays the titular role of the Lady in the Water. She does a good job with the role but is given very little to do and even less dialogue. I left the film feeling I knew as little about her and her world as I came in with. However, the film isn't so much about her as it is about her effect on the people championed to help her with her journey home.It's a unique and interesting cast of characters who inhabit the world of the apartment complex. There is a critic who foreshadows events by his knowledge of movies, a man obsessed with crossword puzzles, a Korean woman and her granddaughter who know the legend of the young woman's world, a man who is conducting an experiment of building up his musculature on only one side of his body among others. Somewhat distracting is M. Night Shyamalan narcissistically casting himself as a writer whose work is so profound it will change the world.Because the characters and their actions were written so broadly and stereotypically, it was often difficult to tell if these were supposed to be real people mystically brought together to mirror the fairytale or if they were part of the fairytale being told. Always quirky, the characters interactions are frequently funny while the creatures trying to prevent the young woman from returning home are often frightening. The computer-generated presentation of the creatures is interesting and adds to the atmosphere because they are never clearly seen. They are seen mostly through darkness and in shadows with lights, sound and description used for enhanced effect.While I enjoyed the movie, I left feeling something was missing and wanting more. The ending felt abrupt and incomplete, adding to the confusion. If these were supposed to be real people drawn together to help a young woman only known because of a fairytale, the potential for growth existed for all of the tenants in this journey but the film stops short of showing how any of them are changed for their experience. The film is worth seeing for the direction, cinematography, characters and concept, unfortunately the storytelling itself is less than clear.",N/A

57607,"If death takes a holiday shouldn't everyone in the world stop dying? Now that would be an interesting premise for a film. Death, it seems, is not a socialist. He admires and wishes to learn from a rich, successful capitalist rather than someone who has foresaken worldly goods in the service of the poor, for instance, or a prisoner of conscience in some gulag somewhere. The wine list is terrible in those places and anyway, death knows what 'The Stranglers' know, that is, it's only the children of the wealthy that tend to be good looking. Although they put it in more Anglo Saxon terms, if memory serves. The industrialist is played by Anthony Hopkins who obviously seems to view himself as an elder statesman to such an extent that he barely appears to be in the picture. He is smug and avuncular and you expect him to break out into a royal wave at any moment. Rather than lend a hand to some poor peasant whose about to have their land taken away from them by a tyrant, death lends a hand to a walking dollar sign in a less than scintilating boardroom battle that is supposed to have us laughing and cheering. Death is a bit repugnant, it seems.Slow and long, the director fancies this as his 'Being There', only you get Pitt instead of Sellars. Pitt is gorgeous but looking at that face for three hours is like gorging on a box of chockies. Too much of a good thing makes you want to throw. Death bends his own rules and let's a very good looking man go on living, presumably because blood on such a sharp suit may ruin any future job interview as a male model. We can't have that, can we? As the fireworks explode and the camera pulls back on a scene of outdoor opulance, we are reminded that it's a hard life for the privileged in letting go. No longer will they be able to watch films which make them feel good about being American. I mean, death loves America. He loves low cut dresses.

Ultimately this movie has been done many times before... and much better. I couldn't help but see similarities between this and ""Meatballs.""14 year old Duncan is shy and awkward and stuck going on vacation with his mom, jerk of a boyfriend, and his daughter. Yes this is not going to be a good summer. Upon his arrival, his neighbors offer some option for companionship but being awkward, friendship with the older pretty girl next door isn't likely. So Duncan follows this charismatic manager of the local water park, Owen. Owen, like Bill Murry in Meatballs... is funny and doesn't take life too seriously. Owen also sees that Duncan needs someone to believe in him badly. In essence, Owen is a camp counselor here... just the camp is the water park. Owen hires Duncan and via the employment and support Duncan blossoms, increasing in confidence until in the end he helps his mom leave her jerk boyfriend and gets a kiss from the pretty girl next door.A simple story. Too simple for me. The movie ends awkwardly without much of a pay off. Duncan's transformation doesn't feel earned but rather rushed to get it in for the end. It is touched on for a second but Owen's character raises the question of responsibility much more than in Meatballs. Owen is a park manager... and he acts like a camp counselor (pawning off the work on everyone else). But the movie doesn't want to dwell on any larger issues.  Also the actor who played Duncan probably isn't going to win any academy awards anytime soon. Finally I have NO idea what the title refers to.",N/A

199554,"An irrelevant, dopey, unbelievable subplot involving dad/son/Japanese girlfriend and other personal stuff, along with overacting by Heston and an inexplicably silly performance by Hal Holbrook, is very nearly cause for avoiding this half-baked war movie. I received this edition from Amazon as a gift from a relative.  One previous reviewer noted that if the original movie's 30-minute intro section on the Tokyo Raid and Coral Sea had been retained for the DVD, this would have been a ""much better"" release.  No way.  Besides material stolen from Thiry Seconds Over Tokyo, Tora Tora Tora, and even John Ford's 1942 Pearl Harbor documentary (!), you have a shot of a swastika-clad German Bf109 being shot down by the Japanese (Messerschmitts at Midway?  Mmm, no, I don't buy it); on a carrier deck, a pilot climbs into a 1942 SBD Dauntless and takes off in a 1945 Hellcat; in a sequence of quick shots of AA batteries aboard a Japanese carrier shooting at American planes, you briefly see a shot from an American carrier firing at kamikazes off Okinawa in 1945; a shot of a Jap carrier is labeled ""The Kaga"", but is another unnamed Japanese carrier, looks like the Soryu; there are plenty of shots of larger American Essex class carriers beyond CV-9, none of which had been built in June 1942; and there's lots of color carrier action news footage that's easily recognizable as film shot during the Marianas campaign in 1944.  It's a shame, because by 1976 there existed more than enough authentic footage from early WWII to make three versions of this film. This movie does, probably by accident, have several seconds of slightly colorized b&w footage that was actually shot during the real battle of Midway.  In case no one noticed, almost every American naval officer in this movie, and some of the Army personnel, are out of uniform. The 2 stars of charity I give here are for the last half of the film, which sticks at least fairly accurately to real events, though it short-changes some important ones and ends before the real battle did. The producers might at least have used WWII footage of PBY Catalina patrol planes, but the PBY's shown here have post-Korea paint jobs. Near the end, the film does accurately depict some of the serious horror and blood of carrier warfare. But overall, ""Midway"" doesn't come close to giving us the full import of this battle, which historians class as one of the most influential battles in naval history - - a list that includes Marc Antony's defeat at Actium, the sinking of the Spanish Armada, the Battle of Trafalgar, and even the Battle of the Coral Sea (which preceded Midway by less than a month, but which is cut from this DVD release).  On the other hand, Amazon's price is almost reasonable if you count the battle sequence and added features. But don't expect too much from the  battle scenes -- expect even less from the movie's first hour.

I frankly think that all four of them are capable of making better movies than this crap.  The storyline is strange and it's scary to think that there are women in the world as stupid as Nicole Kidman's character.  Zac Efron winds up being the hero (believe it or not) and the last five minutes of the movie are the most suspenseful.  But the scene in the prison when Nicole's character meets John's character is simply disgusting.  There were a few parts that I didn't grimace through, but overall this movie sucks.",The Paperboy
1308049,"I just want to say I'm reviewing the movie itself here, not the DVD or Blu-ray since they are not yet released at the time of this writing, nor will I buy or rent the home video version of this stinker. I saw ""Predators"" on the Sunday night of it's opening weekend back in July and the stench of this lousy movie is still fresh in my mind. The original Predator is a terrific sci-fi action thriller. It's loud and dumb and full of macho dudes with huge guns tearing up the jungle. No one has ever mistaken Predator for an intelligent film. At the same time, Arnold's action vehicle remains one of the most emimently watchable pieces of pop culture cinema from the 1980s. It's been 23 long years since the first flick came out and I can't count how many times I've seen the film because it's really fun and easy to watch. Memorable location photography, fun characters, intense action and one great villian from outer space. Not that the first film was in any way original or groundbreaking, it was billed as ""Rambo"" meets ""Alien"". That's how it was sold and it worked like magic even though the critics mostly panned it. A lot of kids grew up on that movie, including me. Well those kids are now making movies of their own and here comes ""Predators"", the hamfisted quasi-remake-sequel thing to the original classic sci-fi monster movie. The people behind this new movie have probably immersed themselves in the Predator movies, videogames and comic books. Appearantly nothing good has come of it, because this movie plays like a endless in-joke between fans of the series. It has zero integrity or ideas of it's own.I saw the trailers to Predators and I was enthusiastic about it. Depressed over the miserable Predator 2 with Danny Glover and absolutely disgusted by how pathetic the Alien vs Predator flicks were, I had some hope that the filmmakers were finally ready to set things right. Robert Rodriguez was involved, not as director, but that's ok. The director was Nimrod Antal and he did the effective little movie ""Vacancy"". The trailers were terrific. The Predators kidnap a bunch of human mercenaries and assassins, take them to the Predator home planet and hunt them on that turf. Great set up! Plus we finally get a jungle/forest atmosphere instead of L.A. or Antarctica ( ridiculous ).I was going to go see this new film with a friend but I found out he had never seen the original movie! Yes, there are still men out there who have not seen that absolute essential classic of macho cinema. We rented the original movie the night before and watched it. Everyone was entertained, even me who has seen it countless times before. Then the next night, we head off to the movie theater. Talk about deja vu. There are entire sequences lifted from the original. Beyond the return of the memorable score, ( which I didn't mind at all ), there was that waterfall scene all over again, there was the Billy makes a stand scene regurgitated with a Yakuza gangster. It went on and on. The big ideas of this insipid film were things like C.G.I. Predator dogs, two different Predator races and Laurence Fishburne in a pointless cameo apperance.The cast was in no way memorable. Adrien Brody does a lot of grunting but seeing him go toe to toe with the biggest, meanest, toughest alien was silly. Even Arnold was wiped out but Brody can handle things? Absurd nonsense. The other characters had little to no personality. Compare this lame squad with the likes of Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Sonny Landham. And what about the chick with the big gun ( Alice Braga )? Does every action film need a chick with a gun? Finally... Topher Grace, the dork from ""That 70s Show"", doing his annoying schtick yet again. It's all a bit too much. The writing is subpar to say the least, the dramatic tension that one so desperately needs in a sci-fi thriller is completely non-existent. I didn't care about the fate of any character in the entire movie. The Predator mythology is barely expanded at all, we just find out that there is more than one race of predators and that they are at war with each other. Nothing more about the planet, it's history or anything. Brody just tells the audience, ""This planet is a game reserve and we're the game."" How does he know that? How did he figure that out in 15 minutes after just waking up in a sky diving freefall? Well, he doesn't know jack, it's just the poor mechanics of the screenplay that are working themselves out to give the audience information.I could go on and trash this hapless film for all it's worth as a way of retribution for getting me into the movie theater and taking my money but I'll leave things on a good note. This movie is much better than the awful Alien vs Predator movies. At the same time, never did I imagine that I would actually think of Predator 2 as a decent film but man, that stupid sequel from 1990 is light years ahead of Predators. That sequel embellished the mythology, pumped up the action and the violence and had crazy Gary Busey, wild man Bill Paxton and of course Danny Glover.Predators is a poor sequel and does nothing to add to the mystery of this venerable movie monster. It's a decent little midnight movie when you're alone at home with nothing to do before going to bed. That's the best I can say about it. I wish it was much better but it can't be when money and exploiting a lucrative property are the sole motives for this film's existence.",Predators

I kept thinking that it HAD to get better, but it just plodded along like an old tired horse. The Dodge City scene leaves you scratching your head. It did not match the rest of the film at all and wasn't even funny. Now, the photography is beautiful, the scenery is beautiful and the transfer is beautiful. I made myself watch it to the end, and even listened to some of the commentary. One very interesting moment of the film and commentary (SPOILER) is one of the very last scenes when the Indian chief shoots his son. This was filmed on November 22, 1963 at the very same time as the JFK assasination. This troubled Sal Mineo for years.

928853,"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is the first in wave of brand new Final Fantasy VII related sequels called The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII Project. I say its Square-Enix's attempt at milking the cash-cow that is their first blockbuster game until its poor utter bleeds. This movie is pure fan gratification for the people that remain in love with game even though it is quickly approaching its tenth year anniversary. Granted, its not even good fan gratification.I'll preface why I think Advent Children is a poor tribute to hard-core fans, casual fans, and newcomers alike, by stating my game credentials. Final Fantasy VII annoyed me. It was a good game. I liked it when it came out, but I place it in the middle-lower end of series' quality spectrum. The part that annoys me is that for the last ten years, I've had to listen to the Final Fantasy VII fanboys, most of which have never really played an RPG before or after this one, blow the game completely out of proportion. Now, thanks to this movie, I'm sure this will continue for ten more years since this brainless, empty little affair is getting such high praise.Final Fantasy newcomers, avoid this movie, because what little of the plot makes sense only makes sense if you have played the game. The DVD has a retrospective from the game that is meant to help you out, but it is about twenty-minutes of still screen-shots from the game and it doesn't really cover much other than a few key scenes. It's pretty to look at, but it isn't pretty enough to find yourself awash in two hours worth of dreck.Now onto why Advent Children is a poor tribute for all the fans, casual and hard-core alike. For years, those fans have been begging Square-Enix to remake the game with state-of-the-art technology because the blocky 3D graphics of the early playstation days are really looking ugly. That is about the only thing Advent Children does: it looks pretty. Character models are gorgeous and as close to photorealistic as I've ever seen. When the camera isn't zipping around during fight scenes and people aren't doing ridiculous acrobatic combat, its easy to forget that everything you see is all computer generated. When it shifts into its numerous fight scenes, the audience is treated to frantic and cool-looking battles, at least in the first quarter of the movie. As the film approaches its climax, the combat becomes more and more ridiculous. People jump higher than superman. Two men engage in a fifteen minute sword fight while airborne the entire time. A motorcycle chase doesn't even try to adhere to the laws of physics. It becomes too much. Which brings me to my first point. The overall style of this movie is more suited to a game like Devil May Cry than any of the Final Fantasy series. I'll honestly say that if combat in the movie resembled the way it looks in the game, it would have been lame, but then again I ever imagined Cloud Strife as having the same moves as Neo from the Matrix.Point number Two is: The plot is a mess and the characterization is poor. This thing is so amateurishly written its sad, considering the plot/character progression is what so many people adored about the game. First, you must forget that misanthropic ending that implied that saving the world caused the extinction of the humans. In Advent Children, everyone is alive, but not so well. A strange sickness is spreading throughout the population called Geo-Stigma. Three white-haired men show up looking for the head of Jenova. It's up the heroes of Final Fantasy VII to stop their evil plot, but main character Cloud Strife is too busy being a sad little emo-kid who feels useless and refuses to fight. Cloud spends most of the movie moping about over issues I thought he had already resolved in the game, which gives the other characters time to make cameo appearances. Everyone outside of Cloud feels extraneous in this movie. Being that it is so Cloud-centric, its Surprising that Cloud doesn't have the best scenes. The most amusing and enjoyable scenes belong to the characters affiliated with the Shinra Corporation and they weren't even playable characters in the game. Everything culminates to a climax in which the dead villain Sephiroth comes back from the dead for one last duel with Cloud. I wonder what preteen fan fiction writer Square Enix found to write this plot, because that is exactly what it amounts to.To be honest, I don't know what I was expecting from this movie. I think I was at least hoping not to dislike it, but that's exactly what happened. The idea of watching this a second time is almost unbearable. If this is a taste of future videogames from Square will look like, we are lucky in did, but we all need to hope that Square keeps their future endeavors in the realm of videogames.It's not easy to create something that retains such a strong following a decade after its release. Final Fantasy VII fans deserved better after a decade of support",N/A
484613,"This is one of those movies that I found prfoundly disappointing because it had the potential to be one of the greatest of the American Sci-Fi films and it blew it.The movie is great in that there is an attempt to respect  the laws of physics and mechanics. So, an astronaut is lost because he  approaches a derilict spacecraft at too high a velocity to hold on.  The  others can't rescue him due to lack of fuel, and the lengthy startup  procedure for the spaceship.  I couldn't help thinking that in another  movie there would have been 15 minutes of death-defying stunts and whizzing  spaceships to rescue the astronaut.  I also thought that the ship used to  fly to Mars was very realistically designed.The problem with the movie  is the requirement to basically watch a 15 minute home-movie before the  action begins, more home-movies in the spacecraft headed to Mars, and  finally an extra-terresrial at the end that looks like it belongs in a B  grade Sci-Fi flick of the 50's.

1381189,"Saw this on the airplane.While the premise of a teacher who hates her students is definitely serviceable, I was annoyed by two things:1.  In the movie, the teacher's supposedly brutal sense of humor was too soft.  She really should have been much crueler.  I think this is because the film was going for the wrong sense of humor.  It was going for the shock-joke nature of comedy, while it should have been aiming at a sardonic, ironic kind of humor.  I kept waiting for her to unload some nasty, soul-crushing comments on the students or other faculty, but instead she was just a paper tiger.2.  While her character was well-sketched, she underwent a complete, unprovoked reversal at the very end that betrayed everything that had gone before.  Quite apart from the fact that that ending could be seen coming from a mile way, the movie hadn't ""earned"" it.  It felt abrupt, felt like they had just done it because her renouncing her big goal abruptly at the end of the movie and starting to love teaching was what was expected by the audience.  But the movie would have been tons more effective and memorable if she stuck it out through the end, got her plastic surgery, and then given everyone the finger at the end of the movie.  It would have been much truer to her character and the nature of the film in general.In other words, ruined by a Hollywood ending.",N/A

1693519,"I have so many swirling issues with a film like &#8216;Stranger by the Lake&#8217;, so deciding where to start in the context of a review is difficult.  I guess I could map out the film&#8217;s plot first, which will take all of three seconds.  Franck is cruising the gay side of a lake, looking for a hookup when he meets Henri, a fat and lonely man who sits alone awaiting someone to talk to.  They become friends.  Then Franck sees Michel, an attractive and mysterious man and he&#8217;s hooked.  When Franck literally watches Michel murder someone at the lake, he becomes even more entranced and delves deep into a sexual relationship, despite the police swarming the scene looking for answers to the murder.The problem with this is that none of this is even remotely interesting.  The sex, violence and suspense are just dull.There are literally two things that I enjoyed about this film.  Patrick D'Assumao is really, really good as Henri.  His scenes with Pierre Deladonchamps (who plays Franck) are the only glimpses into any sort of backstory or point to this film, but they are sadly too few.  Also, the final frames, that climax (pun intended) is exceptionally directed.I&#8217;m done.The heap of praise that this film has received has baffled me a bit.  I&#8217;ve debated this with some friends who don&#8217;t feel as I do, and I still cannot bring myself to get their point, even though I kind of want to (who wants to be the odd man out).  Still, as much as they defend this, I find myself more and more convinced that it doesn&#8217;t work.  I am one who often praises minimalism, but &#8216;Stranger by the Lake&#8217; is so minimalist that it basically goes absolutely nowhere.  The first half just hangs there pointlessly, doing nothing to really propel or even build a real story.  When the murder happens, it all feels so unimportant, and the way that the film just keeps moving forward only cements that.  But then, when the body is found and it feels like maybe something is going to pick up, the film doesn&#8217;t feel even remotely concerned with making it all work.  I just didn&#8217;t go anywhere for me.  It just meandered meaninglessly and felt so hollow.The direction felt so lazy, but maybe that is the wrong word.  Underdeveloped?  Unformulated?I guess maybe if the suspense that so many have noted were there, I would have reacted better to this film, but I never felt remotely moved (in any way) by any of this (outside of Henri).  Everything just seemed to hang there lifelessly.  So many have noted suspense building in the moment when Franck follows Michel into the lake, but I felt nothing.  Nothing felt delved into, and I don't mean from a &#34;let's play ominous music and have an intense action scene&#34; but I never felt like these were even real characters.  I took something away from Henri&#8217;s fate, and at least he made me ponder, but outside of him (and he was not the focal point so there was a lot outside of him) I just couldn&#8217;t muster a care.But someone told me that this movie is about HIV, and like, with all the careless, unprotected sex going on, it makes sense in a way, but not in a way that makes me reevaluate the movie itself.",N/A

1184017,"American cities of the northeast are plagued by an apparent terrorist attack in which people become confused then suicidal - leaping off skyscrapers, shooting themselves, impaling themselves with hairpins. As high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his unhappy wife and colleague flee to the country, it becomes evident the threat is more likely environmental. Nature is fighting back, with plants releasing some kind of toxin to defend themselves against the human industrial onslaught...M. Night Shyamalan executes on this charming premise with a deliberate eye to the sci-fi B-movie, both in style and theme, with lashings of gore, a cheesy score, and expository dialogue that at times sounds more like a textbook. Sadly, however, it doesn't entirely work. Shyamalan's no fool. He wouldn't make a B-movie without a specific intention. So what's going on here? Is the substance connected to the style? Does Shyamalan want us to go back to the 1950s? Is he trying to tell us that cities are bad? Is he echoing E. F. Schumacher's cry that ""small is beautiful""? Or is this a response to misplaced moral hysteria around 9/11? Falling bodies around 9.00am on a New York Tuesday certainly stir the echoes. Is he saying there are bigger threats to worry about than a few ideologues in planes; that 9/11, though a tragic event for those involved, is ultimately a miniscule blip compared to our disastrous global environmental trajectory? Or is it simply a musing on the fragility of humankind and the paucity of our knowledge? He'd be right on all counts, of course. But his intention is never clear.As an argument the film isn't very convincing, and as a piece of entertainment it's worse. Shyamalan's core skills as a writer-director seem to have deserted him - there is no suspense, no real drama, no trademark twist, not even any really nice shots (except the chilling iconic beauty of the falling workmen). It offers just a vague kind of discomfort that's regularly undermined by the near-comic suicide scenes. Shyamalan seems creatively paralysed himself. Still, the film's not entirely without merit. Its difference to standard summer fare makes it reasonably engaging for much of its short duration, and the wheels only really fall off when Moore and family let the power of love trump the power of self-preservation with a very convenient outcome.I think Shyamalan's also a victim of his own success - expectations are incredibly high for anything he does. From a young, first-time writer-director, this might be seen as competent Hollywood fare with an eye to tradition. From Shyamalan, it's well below par. Wahlberg is probably the strongest element here. He's regularly undermined by appalling dialogue, but his earnestness is endearing. Knowing where he's come from, as an actor and a person, to see him playing this kind of character in this kind of movie is nice.",N/A
1033137,"Guy Ritchie's previous British crime thrillers have their detractors, but they also have an amiable charm and cocky intelligence that are hard to resist.This new one, however, is not like the others.This is a movie that's so wound up, so pumped full of macho barium, that it eventually becomes an excruciating experience.Ritchie stretches out this time -- both in terms of plot and ambition -- and loads the movie with more style than all his previous movies combined. Wild sets and characters? Yes. Grandiosity that approaches Greenaway? Yes. Operatic in sound and scale and peppered with an occasionally cool shoot-out? Sure.But it's all shot through with a plot so intentionally convoluted, and Luc Besson production style so brassy and arranged, that watching ""Revolver"" quickly becomes like flipping through the ads in Vanity Fair with a 105-degree fever.  And not in a good way, either.In his commentary, Ritchie admits he's playing with the idea of ego and the notion that enemies and competition are all simply a product of the individual's interior desires.  That's a great concept on which to base a crime thriller but the movie is overloaded with too-obvious twists, faux-""Fight Club"" camera tricks and a ridiculously overblown sense of drama. Some scenes that inexplicably involve animation don't help either -- they don't make sense within the story and only serve to draw more comparisons to Tarantino, who did all this first and better within ""Kill Bill.""You know you're in trouble when you're watching a movie and you realize everybody in the film cares way, way more about the situations at hand than you do. In the case of ""Revolver,"" I'm pretty sure the main characters were 210% more concerned with the goings on of the story than I was.Meanwhile, a tangerine-tan Ray Liotta -- as, ostensibly, ""the bad guy"" -- spends most of the movie threatening his underlings and colorfully demanding they kill his enemies. Andre 3000 is joltingly self-conscious as a mysterious loan shark. And lead Jason Statham wanders through it all knowing his character is being played by some kind of scam, but submitting anyway. We know this because he spends the bulk of a seemingly endless voiceover reiterating what's already painfully obvious to the viewer.The most interesting part of the film is actually the end credits. That's when Ritchie rolls out interviews with experts and pundits talking about the concept of the ego. The fiction pushed me away, but the facts (or the search for facts) actually pulled me back.",Revolver (2005) (Region 2)

255048,"From just about anyone's standpoint, this is not a good film.  But the problem isn't the directing.  William Shatner clearly knows how to handle a camera and draws fine performances from the cast (especially DeForest Kelley).The problem with Star Trek V centers on the script.  There is an old Broadway saying, &quot;If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.&quot;  The failure of this movie proves the validity of that truism.  Since Shatner is listed as one of the persons behind the story here, he must bear his fair share of the responsibility for the problems with this story.  Creating a script about the search for a tangible God, even if it winds up  being a false God, sets the viewer up for disappointment.  No matter how spectacularly the Almighty is presented on film, it can't live up to the real thing.  In this film, He comes across as a latter day Wizard of Oz.  Compounded with that are the problems with continuity within the Trek &quot;universe,&quot; and overall tone: introducing Sybok as Spock's half-brother, and the use of the cast for slapstick humor, do not help an already implausible story.  Small wonder Gene Roddenberry did not consider this film to be canonical Trek.The special effects, which are crude and amateurish, do not help matters.  However, the special effects during the original series were often sub-par, yet the old shows continue to satisfy even in today's CGI era.  (Anyone with any doubts about that should simply check how well the Original Series DVDs have been selling on Amazon.) The anemic visuals merely add to the problems here because they are coupled to a weak script.About the most charitable thing one can say about this film is that it features a wonderful score from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith.

Well let start with the good points.1) The voilence- it is truly stepped up a notch here.  Not gore but the violence. Itreally seemed to fit this Myers.  He is no longer thisboogieman type character but a sadistic brutal killer.2) Myers - Though I still like the original better this one is still great.  He'sdifferent.  Most will either love him or hate him not to many in themiddle.3) Dreams - We got to see what was driving Myers, what was going on in his head.Now what was bad1)Dr. Loomis -  Man does this Loomis really suck.  I mean the original really  helped make the movies. With out him the movie would have weakened greatly.  This Loomis nearly destroy's the movie.2) Dreams - I can't really go into this to much without giving some things up but lets just say there to many of them and they should have been limited to Myers.All in all I would like to have given 2 1/2 stars.  I think it would not be out of the question to give it a 3 star but that would be stretching it.  If Rob would just have had a better Loomis this movie would have been soooo much better.",N/A
755623,"Anyone who calls this work, ""brilliant"" is being really pretentious because on the whole, this is just an average piece on 'slavophile' culture in disguise. The director, whose boldness is like a blistering piece of annoying garbage on one's face on a cold Norwegian day, states that the, ""Hermitage is the greatest museum in the world."" Just from that statement we can then further evaluate that this film is 1) going to rely on manipulating history for its own plight 2) portraying Russians as 'wonderful people and 3) allowing us to see insignificant pieces of junk stolen from countless of eras in the museum. 4) He is completely insane.The film itself was made on one shot by a half bald cinematographer from Germany who complained of back pain after the whole shoot because he was carrying a mobile camera that weighed 250 lbs. Further touches in the editing room configured rooms with dark shadows and an eerie earth tone that seemed almost 'dead like"" and made it seem like this was a Hollywood film.There's not much in the way of the story except an unknown and unseen drunk, played by the camera itself, finds himself in a dank and stench filled restroom, which is actually the foundation of the Hermitage somewhere around the year 1689 and then he encounters a pretentious and annoying old count played by some Russian oaf. All he does is blather around and look at pieces for unusually long periods of time and comment on irrelevant tokens of opportunity such as a beautiful woman walking by who isnt hiding the fact that she has big [.!.]. They keep going into a time machine, which transports them into the next room of the museum, I kept wishing it was the exit, and they keep on commenting about the pieces and about the situation at hand. It isn't even philosophy because the old Russian crank is a really arrogant jerk and he keeps saying stupid things such as, ""I wonder if the Czar eats with butter?"". Its all terribly boring and we must sit through 2 hours worth of it until the end where a bunch of stuffy extras in period pieces dance around a ballroom with Tchaivsky playing in the background.  Too bad he couldn't film the lot of the peasants who were freezing and starving to death!There's not much to say in the way of art even, because most of it is fake to begin with, there was a fire in the Hermitage during World War 2 in which most of the museum itself was encapsulated within a great fire. Let's hope the director doesn't make a pure film on the virtues of Stalin next. (yawn, yawn)",Russian Ark VHS
1391205,"I am really unsure of how to sum up On Stranger Tides in simple words. Before I begin this review, let me state 2 things: 1. I absolutely love the first three movies, and 2. To that guy who said ""the skinny girl is not in the movie"", that skinny girl is named Kiera Knightley. OK, now moving on, sort of.The first three movies were good old fashioned fun that didn't take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed them all very much and have seen them numerous times. I thought Verbinski did a hell of a job, considering he was a punk rock video director before a filmmaker. When I heard a fourth movie was being made, I got super excited. However, I had a stirring feeling of disappointment when I found out Verbinski was not directing. I'm not down with Rob Marshall- I thought Chicago was overrated and Nine was a confusing and slow mess. But, it's a Pirates movie, so I figured it'd be fun.Since I'm kinda pressed for time, I will sum up what I liked and didn't like.FIrst, the cast were great as per usual. Visually it was entertaining and the movie moved along at a nice pace... for the first hour. That, and Penelope Cruz is hot!!! And she did a great job as Angelica. Blackbeard was a cool villain, and Ian McShane does a fantastic job. There's a creepy scene involving mermaids, and that got a good reaction from those at the theatre.The bad... is everything else. First off, Barbossa is in the movie for only 20 minutes. The last hour is boring, drags a lot, and that's not all- there's a MAJOR plot hole involving the fountain of youth which is really annoying. And the 3D sucked.Overall, this is not a bad movie, but the writers are running out of ideas and it's clear.PROS:-Great acting-Hans Zimmer's score rules-Nice after the credits codaCONS-Pointless characters including the mermaid and the religious dude-About 30 minutes too long-Jack thinks far too much in this film-Drags greatly in the second half",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides
1596613,"This semi-art house, semi-perverse film is only for lovers of true indie horror.  That said, this was well-done considering its shoestring budget.After suffering some serious heart complications, fantasy erotica artist David (Bath Salt Zombies, Easter Casket) strikes a deal with the Devil for a new heart.  He didn't turn to Medicaid or venture to Canada for cheaper solutions&#8230;nope.  The Devil had just what he needed.  And with that David's heart is replaced by a tentacle monster in a wooden chest.  Just one problem:  the monster needs to be fed living flesh in order to survive.  The monstrous heart is eloquently voiced by an Bill Nighy sound-alike.Writer/director Dustin Mills (Bath Salt Zombies) clearly made an effort with this script.  His writing is far from brilliant, but he definitely deserves credit for delivering far more than I've come to expect from the vast majority of direct-to-DVD horror.  Theatrical devices like overt melodrama, narration and asides add an irregular flavor to this film.  Whereas this flavor may please the art house crowd, some may find it over-the-top and distasteful.Speaking of distasteful&#8230;  Is there a lot of sexuality and perversion?  Yes.  But I see it as being used more as an exploitative &#34;device&#34; than purely as a crutch to cover the film's shortcomings.  There's masturbation, which seems to reveal our protagonist's desperation, and nudity, which does not utilize the typical stripper-cast actresses. There are also several sex scenes with little to no nudity.Some of the acting in this is real crap (sorry, but I'm referring especially to Dustin Mills' cameo) and the effects are about as cheap as they come.  But considering this film had a budget of about $1500, I think I'll let it slide.  If you can make anything that entertains me for that cheap, then you've succeeded as a filmmaker.  The closing action sequence is awful and fun.I should note that whereas this film is not nearly as deep or art house-ish as Lo (2009), the style is similar enough to warrant comparison.  Those who love true indie horror will likely enjoy this film.  But just because you consider yourself an adventurous horror-goer, that doesn't mean this is for you.",Night Of The Tentacles
1074842,"Seeing the preview for this movie, I knew two things: 1) Terrence Howard would likely give a great performance, 2) it would have a great soundtrack.I was right on both counts.  Terrence Howard is one of my favorite actors these days (seeHustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition), even if rap music isn't your thing).  His work here as an amateur swim coach is solid.  And the music featured throughout the movie is classic '70s soul and r&b;, so if you like that stuff - crank up the volume.What I didn't know for sure after seeing the preview - but strongly suspected - was that the movie would be formulaic and predictable.  This suspicion was confirmed after viewing the movie.  But what surprised me was just how poorly the forumla is executed.  I love this kind of movie when it's well done.  Even when I know pretty much what will happen, I can easily get caught up in the insprirational rush.  This one doesn't work, for a number of reasons.  The kids who decide to form a swim team - they aren't even allowed one personality trait each.  Sure, there is the poor student who's guardian doesn't want him to be even more distracted from his schoolwork by extracirricular activities.  But for the most part, the ensemble of young actors - and one actress - who make up the underdog swim team aren't given anything specific to do.  Well, they like swimming, but that's about it.  In fact, when the all-boys team gets a first female member, nothing even slightly interesting is done with that plot development.Bernie Mac plays the manager of the youth center - scheduled to be closed down - at which Terrence Howard and his charges train for swim meets.  Howard is a government worker who is told to close up the rec center.  Mac's character is very disgruntled by the prospect of losing the center (which is so unfrequented that he can sit around watching soap operas all day).  Later, he becomes friends with Howard and helps the swim team in what are quite frankly unspecified ways.  I liked Mac's performance quite a bit - he's funny at times, but it's mostly a dramatic performance.  But the reasons he warms up to Howard and his attempts to organize a competitive swim team are unclear.Anyway, the movie chugs along and hits all the expected plot points as Howard helps the kids learn to take pride in themselves.  The all-black team is met with harsh and disturbing racism (including racist white audience members at a swim meet who laugh derisively when one of the black swimmers injures himself).  These elements are all handled fairly perfunctorily - the strength being found primarily in the excellent acting.When it comes right down to it - swimming just doesn't translate particularly well to cinema.  Unlike many other sports, there are great limitations in maintaining visual interest in multiple people swimming in a pool.",N/A

805919,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, as I love the story of Peter Pan, but this version just didn't work for me.First of all, while staying true to Barrie's original story, the first 30 minutes almost appeared to be a remake of Spielberg's ""Hook"" than a novelization of the story. Even the music sounded similar to John Williams' 1991 score. I found myself immediately disliking the actor who portrayed Pan, and most especially, his horrible grin that he felt the need to show every 30 seconds. I wouldn't say he was a bad actor, but he definitely was guilty of overacting during MANY instances of this film, and he just wasn't a very likeable kid in general. The only actor who I disliked more is Ludivine Sagnier as Tinkerbell. I really wish they would have killed her off in the first few minutes because she became VERY annoying. She is a fairly odd-looking person, which I guess fairies are supposed to be, but if anyone on this film was guilty of overacting it's definitely her. All of her ridiculous facial expressions were just plain annoying rather than cute. I really hated seeing her onscreen, and I didn't buy her love for Pan like I did with Julia Roberts in ""Hook."" She didn't seem to have any remorse about trying to have Wendy killed, so it was hard to like this character.The film also contains some ridiculous action sequences that came off looking absurd. At one point there are two children riding on the back of a dog, while lying on their backs. In another, a child is flipped through the air and looks like he's doing cartwheels in space or something. In the opening scene, Pan is trying to catch his shadow in Wendy's room, and breaks or knocks over half of the furniture in his attempt. 10 minutes later, and after the room is destroyed, we're shown that Wendy's brothers are in the same room asleep! I don't know if they were on drugs or what but there's no way they could have slept through that.Cinematography on this film is excellent however. The film makes an excellent audio and video transfer to disc. This is one of the most phenomenal visual representations I've seen of a movie on home video and the colors really stand out, especially during the flight to Neverland.The extras are where the DVD falls flat. No audio commentary, which I feel really would have been nice for such a fantastically visually represented film. Instead, there are about 25 very short video featurettes, averaging 1-2 minutes in length. While interesting, they're all just crammed in there, with no real organization. Some featurettes are organized under the ""Captain Hook"" or ""Neverland Forest"" section, but then have nothing really to do with these and are basically just a bunch of behind the scenes clips. I think they definitely should have spent some more time with this and organized 5 or 6 decent featurettes in a cohesive manner rather than throw a bunch of small clips on there to make it look like there were more extras.Overall, I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, and most likely it will be enjoyed by a younger audience. However, it failed to catch my attention as an adult, and it seems like this is something that could have been accomplished with a few small changes and different casting decisions. The original DVD release presents a beautiful transfer of the film, but if you really enjoyed this movie, I'd lobby for a better edition than the one they currently have out.",N/A
1044361,"Not an entirely great movie. Movie is about a man who has been in jail three times, sentenced by the same judge everytime. When he gets out for the third time, he wants revenge on the judge who sentenced him, but finds out that the judge has recently died. So, he decides to get revenge on the judge's son by sending him to jail. However, he also does something to get himself arrested and sentenced to several years in prison so that he can be there while the judge's son serves his time.Basically, the whole movie is about life in jail and how this man tries to make the judge's son have a horrible time in prison. It goes from fights, to homosexuality, deaths, etc. Anything that you might expect to happen in prison does, so its not a big surprise.The movie is not really that funny, there are only a couple of times when you laugh, but not all that much. Don't really recommend it and its not a movie to remember.",N/A

The movie is about a group of campers who go to Ireland to do ""shrooms"" or ""magic mushrooms""(what they were called in my day)in the woods. Having dabbled in many things in my youth, I know this is a bad, BAD idea! The films starts off like so many other horror movies going to unfamiliar surroundings to party and have sex, then tell a scary story to freak everyone out before going to bed. Lots of clich&eacute;'s fill this watch-able but, ultimately forgettable horror film. I did like the ending a little, as it seemed to make this all seem possible.

1602120,"Everyone is well aware of the ups and downs of actor Charlie Sheen's life over the past few years. Some love him, some hate him, but for the most part I think the majority of American's have the same opinion about these well publicized turmoil's: who cares?Celebrities seem to garner attention for the worst behavior possible and people these days seem to think that's cool. It doesn't say much for us does it?But Sheen has come back from the wild ways he displayed and attempted to not only create a new series that he can star in but that can poke fun at his past behavior at the same time. ANGER MANAGEMENT stars Sheen as Charlie Goodson, an ex-major league baseball player who in a fit of rage tried to break a bat over his leg...only to injure himself instead and thus ending his career. Seeing the light so to speak he in turn became an anger management therapist with a successful private practice. He still occasionally finds himself on the verge of anger but seems to catch it most times.Charlie's main focus is on a group he offers therapy to in his home. They run the stereotypical range from grumpy old guy to total whack job girlfriend. While some of these characters have moments that might make you laugh on the whole they become more cardboard cutouts than actual people you get to know.Charlie's character has situations he's chosen to be involved in here that become focal points of various episodes. For one he's divorced but still of fairly good grounds with his ex. Well good in the sense of average sit-com good. Shawnee Smith stars in this role and she's had better parts but holds up well here. The two share a daughter in her early teens which makes for some storylines as well. Of course the things Charlie wants for his daughter and how he wants her to behave are far different from the young girls he hits on throughout the series.When he's not attempting to bed a young girl he meets randomly he's involved with another therapist played by Selma Blair. While the two are involved in a friends with benefits relationship they agree that for this to take place they can't become a therapist for each other...which of course Charlie ends up trying to weasel around when he can.The series is a hit and miss mixture of old stories we've seen before with new attempts to push the envelope as far as it can with sexual taboos. Some episodes are actually hilarious while others just sit there. Never having thought TWO AND A HALF MEN was the funniest thing ever made I thought this series was perhaps even a tad below that level of humor. Watching stars on the tail end of their age bracket and careers involved in sex comedy isn't my cup of tea.Actually that part is rather sad when you think about it. Sheen has acting ability as seen in so many projects he's done in the past. When he took on the role in his previous series he became a caricature of the aging lothario whose life was nothing more than a series of women he attempted to or succeeded in bedding each week. Unfortunately his real life began to mimic this character rather than be an escape from it and that began to inflict itself into that show, enough so that he left. In this show he plays almost the same character with minor differences. It would be nice to see Sheen go back to fulfill the potential he displayed in films like PLATOON rather than this sort of knock off series.On its own perhaps this series can be recommended for a few episodes and some of the jokes can be funny. The problem is you have to sit through the rest of it to get to these gems which are few and far between. Sheen fans who love his off screen antics will fall in love with this character. Those wanting to see a more mature actor will have to wait.",N/A
1322002,"First let me say that I am one of those people who can fall upstairs.  Trees and rocks have been know to find me when I walk or ride a bike.  I also live in Kansas, the FLAT part of Kansas.  This means that going down a snow covered hill very fast has no appeal to me. All this made it hard for me to get excited about the movie FROZEN.  I teach  film studies and our next assignment was to be a film critic.  We discussed the duties of a film critic and so on, so I decided to use this film as the film for them to review.  Since the film had a very short run in theatres and hadn't been seen by the kids, I thought it would be a great one for them to use.  The bottem line is this I found myself watching the film closer looking at how it was made,ie. camera angles, music, set, fx, and watching the reactions of my students.It was a new experience for me, I was taking notes in the dark about the movie on one pad and notes about the kids' reaction on another pad.  Thank Heaven the movie was only 93 minutes long.First thing I noticed was that I didn't ""click"" with the characters.  Their opening dialogue seemed strained and fake.  The male friend compaining to his buddy that the girl was taking away from their guy time just fell flat.  Now if I can not find something in the characters to like then I have no emotional reason to care what happens to them.  This first part got a chuckle and snickering from the kids.  It seemed that a lot time was taken in the first part of the movie at talking about feelings and the male friend finding a girl.  I know that the scene where the boys ""make"" the girl get the lift guy to let them on is a set up for later, but this scene and the way the guys ""shamed"" the girl into doing it seemed sleazy.The dialogue is the main thing that ""killed"" this mvoie.  For example, when they first realize that they are trapped on the lift, what do they talk about?  The different ways to die!  Another time is when the boyfriend is spread out on the ground with his legs 90 degrees from his body with a bone sticking out of his leg, what do they say?  Are you alright?  The effect is one of out and out laughter by the kids.  This mistake underminds  the guy on the ground and what is about to happen to him.  The two in the lift don't just ask this stupid questin once but several times even when the wolves are busy with the boy friend.The music does nothing to help the movie.  The back ground music is classical in nature and does not fit what is happening on the screen.  I found myself aware it when I should have been paying attentin to the movie.I may not ski but I do known about snow and cold and so do my students.  This was judged to be the greatest mistake of all in the movie.  The movie takes place at night  during bad snow snow storm and we all noticed the following things:1.  When the characters talked, the was no puffs of ""smoke"" that would be there if warm breath met cold air.2.  At first when they were trapped and the night turned into a blizzard they didn't shiver.3.  The scene when the male friend tries to climb the cable that there was no ice on it.  There was ice on everything else but not here.4.  They didn't try to huddle for warmth.  Come on now.5.  There is a wind and their clothes don't move in it.6.  The girl is the only one to get frost bite.  Why?But not all was bad.  The director of the movie, Adam Green, also did the movie Hachet.  My kids said this was gross horror mvoie and they liked it.  The scene where the boyfriend jumps is the one scene we watched two or three times because the first part and first reaction was the strongest part of the mvoie.  We noticed that this was well done at first.  The kids said oh the blood but there wasn't any.  The director wisely stage this in such away that the kids' imagination added to the scene what wasn't there.  this was very effective.  But on second viewing things began to come out.  One was why didn't the guy faint?  When looking at the position of the guy the second time the kids noticed that the body and the legs were not in proportion  and at wrong angles.The action scenes are well done and exciting.  The kids responded to these.  It was the parts in between that they hated.  And this is the director's fault.  He also worte the film.The end!!!!!  Well I can not repeat the words that the kids said about the end.  they felt that they had spent 93 minutes of exciting action and dumb dialogue and they got that ending!  I don't even want to tell you the ending.So I would not rent this movie.  If some else rented and asked you come see it...well if is that or taking out the trash, you might want to think long and hard before making decision.P.S.

But it was when it allowed itself to be applied to this stinker. Not only is the writing lousy, the characters are shallow at best, including municipal leaders who conveniently have very short memories as they relive the past and fall perfectly in line with the unimaginative story line. The Brody's themselves seem to have short memories, but they merely symbolize the rest of the town who, despite some awfully familiar clues, jump in and out of the water with wreckless abandon w/o giving the possibility of a shark even a remote consideration. And the shark itself takes on something of a slasher personna in its predatory behavior in the way it chooses its prey. Not to mention how unlike in the original, this shark plays to the camera and takes on un-shark like characteristics, expanding a little more on the original sharks acrobatics. All this sequel needs (as well as the 3rd and 4th installments) is a hockey mask for the shark and the creativity for the plot line would be complete. This may be the best of the ""Jaws"" sequels, but that's like saying the Gremlin was GMC's best car.",N/A
396316,"All right, let's get this out of the way first: This film is thoroughly racist and D. W. Griffith's politics are utterly disgusting.Griffith was one of the most important innovators in cinema, inventing much of the basic grammar of film. It is impossible to underestimate his technical contributions. Birth of a Nation is his most famous--or rather, infamous--film. It's the first blockbuster in movie history, and it made Griffith a very rich man. It dragged cinema out of the age of the two-reeler and showed the studios that there was a huge market for long films and historical epics. It also inspired (if that's the right word) the revival of the Ku Klux Klan and taught millions of white Americans to hate and fear blacks.But, now that all of Griffith's technical innovations have become utterly commonplace (so commonplace, in fact, that even the most amateurish filmmakers use them without thinking), what's left in Birth of a Nation to enjoy and admire? Well, not much, I'm afraid. Lacking the distinct visionary style of the best silent-era filmmakers (Chaplin, Lang, Stroheim, Murnau, Dreyer, etc.), Griffith's work falls flat. There's nothing here to enchant the eye or exercise the mind, which forces one to concentrate entirely on the content. And what paltry content it is. False, ludicrous melodrama and grimacing, hand-waving performances straight out of some 19th-century traveling stock company's production of East Lynne. Cheesy-looking battle re-enactments. The hoariest old cliches unredeemed by any wit or beauty or intelligence.Judged purely on its artistic merits, Birth of a Nation really rates only one star; but since it occupies an important place in film history, I reluctantly give it two stars. Film geeks should watch it once, just to see how far we've advanced--morally, politically, and cinematically--since Griffith's day.",N/A

Also, the killings and gore were quite good and stylish. The only problem I have is the plot..and identity of the killer. Instead of making it 82 minutes, they should have fleshed it out more, creating more of a background on the characters. There is a &quot;secret&quot; that we find out about on the the main characters but it's just spoken once and it just doens't make sense that no one would know about it before. And not to mention that it's not spoken about after that.The only explanation for the events is a simplified one that makes it all seem (like i mentioned) like a preteen horror show. Really, without the gore and language, that's what it is.",N/A

You know your discretionary time has been squandered when the most interesting scene in a movie is a 10 minute segment of competitive dishwasher loading.  Since that interlude was culled from the personal life of the screenwriter (Jenny Lumet) one has to speculate on how far the supposedly creative community has sunk.What we have here is dysfunction melded with stultification, the former exemplified by every member -past, present and potential  - of this Stamford, Connecticut clan: the reluctantly indulgent titular Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt), Kym (Anne Hathaway) the chemically dependent rehab patient sister on a weekend pass, Paul (Bill Irwin) the enabler father, Abby (Debra Winger) the emotionally distant ex-wife and mother, and let's not overlook Carol (Anna Deveare Smith) stepmom and consummate peripheral observer. If that wasn't enough, throw in the groom Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe), who had all the acting range of a guy who knows where the casting director's skeletons are buried and your journey down the highway to personal regret is in fifth gear.The film seemed like an andro inflated homage to multiculturalism. If the director or screenwriter had thought of including a scene or two at the Mohegan Casino, no one would have been left out. But, that may have been interesting and in total contrast to the stupefying pall that permeated the film. Jonathan Demme decided to film with a hand-held camera to give it a video journal feel and he succeeded.

When it first heard about it, I was somewhat sceptical about the movie, thinking that it would simply be another distorted Hollywoodization of an historical event or historical period.  I subsequently read reviews that claimed that it was in fact a great movie, a cut above as it were, and that the movie was sensitive towards Japanese culture etc.  In particular what I found most interesting was the claim that the movie was not the typical Western film where Western values are proven superior--that the reverse is in fact the case here.  But still, I was sceptical, and did not concern myself with the movie until just a few days ago.  All things considered, I think I was justified in my scepticism; while there were aspects that I found to be good and commendable (the majestic landscape, quite stunning combat sequences), for the most part I just did not find it to be a good film.

1286823,"Have you ever seen one of those previews for a film that made it seem as if it was the greatest idea in the world? All the flash and bang, all the explosions, all the quick quips that make it seem exciting and witty and worth your money to see? But then when you see the film you realize that all the best parts were spliced together in such a way that the preview was more entertaining than the actual movie? Such is the case with GAMER.In the future mega whiz Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) is a computer genius who has created two games that everyone plays. The first is recognizable as a Sims style game but with a difference. Volunteers have had nanobytes placed in their brains that allow them to be controlled by game players to do their bidding. This includes everything from standing on their head to having sex. The nanobytes also give the game players the opportunity to view all that goes on.The second game, Slayers, is a more adventurous one. In this one, the nanobytes have been implanted on prisoners sitting on death row. Game players control these people in a dangerous setting, each armed with real weapons as they make their way to a goal through high powered obstacles placed in their way. Their objective is to play the game out and win so many times and in return the player (or prisoner in this case) is granted his or her freedom.As the film begins Kable (Gerard Butler) is the most popular of the pieces in play. Simon (Logan Lerman) is Kable's controller/game player and the duo has gone further than any others in the game. Kable is nearing the chance to be free but of course the powers that be can't have that (shades of ROLLERBALL!). Instead the rig the game to make sure he loses.But Kable has a plan of his own. Via flashbacks we get a glimpse of the life he led before, some of which he can recall but not everything. Kable has a family and a life he misses and somehow Castle was involved in taking it away. Not until a final confrontation are we privy to what that connection is.Along the way we get to see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Alleta) as she plays the Sims style game as a pawn for an overweight slob who controls her into some seriously strange situations. Those involved in this game seem intent on displaying the most depraved situations everywhere. Of course, this is graphically viewed by anyone watching this DVD. Suffice to say gratuitous nudity for the sake of gratuitous nudity is on hand.Another plot line involves rebels out to take down Castle and his plans at world domination via game players and nanobytes. They interfere with Kable and Simon in the hopes that Kable will survive no matter what is thrown at him and then have the chance to find Castle.So what about the movie as a whole? It's quite disappointing with many of the action sequences the preview promoted short and far between. The plot seems thin at best and copied from various other films in the past at worst. The pacing is slow, the set up lame and the payoff predictable from early on.The acting in this film is standard with no outstanding performances. Those involved offer little or no emotion, seeming more like the characters seen in video games that they discuss. Even Butler, who I think is becoming a better actor as he goes, offers nothing that makes this one something to seek out.The effects take center stage here, most notably the camerawork. So much so that one of the main extra features discusses the camera system they used to get the look they wanted. If you've seen either CRANK film (by the same directors) you know the look I'm talking about. But while that film offered many tongue in cheek moments, this one just doesn't match up to the promises made in the previews.Die hard Butler fans will want to seek this out. Others may want to rent it just to see what its like. But if you were given a copy of this as a gift, watch it and then take it to your local DVD trader before everyone else does.",N/A

I guess that means I'm part of the reason why bad low budget movies like Death on Demand keep getting made.  All is not a total loss here, though - sure, the acting is atrocious and the script is juvenile, but there's a decent amount of gore involved.For any insane killer, there's always someone more than willing to exploit that person's crimes for material gain.  Twenty years ago, ice climber Sean McIntyre returned home (after losing it on a climb and killing his Sherpa guide because he thought he was a Yeti) to his loving family, only to slaughter all of them and then hang himself.  Now, a young entrepreneur has put together a Halloween night webcast in the house, giving one of three local college couples a chance at winning five grand - if they can solve all of the clues scattered around the place and find their way out.  Eager to prove himself to his doubting father, he's somehow managed to replace one of the original contestants with adult film star Velvet Luv in order to sell more online subscriptions.  Velvet is partnered up with an emo lesbian (whose voice is even more annoying than Fran Drescher's), while the other couples consist of two antagonistic football jocks (Biff and Brad) and their girlfriends.  Brad and Biff epitomize all of the worst stereotypes you've ever heard about football players - and they dislike each other intensely.  After a s&eacute;ance to call up the spirit of Sean McIntyre, the contest finally begins.  It's fun to watch the reaction of the contestants' buddies back at the dorm, but the action inside the house is just stupid and boring.  Of course, we all know what's going to happen to these annoying characters.Apart from the gore, it doesn't look as if anyone made any effort whatsoever to make this a movie worth watching.  This is truly a film that only a bad movie lover can possibly enjoy.  Those without a weird sense of humor and a weakness for really stupid movies may find themselves fantasizing about the death of director Adam Matalon and everyone else involved in this embarrassingly bad film.",Death on Demand
1319783,"Isn't it nice to have the time, the resources, and the money to be able to travel the world and rediscover life, love, and spirituality? We should all be as lucky as Elizabeth Gilbert. Her memoir, ""Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia,"" has sold millions, been on the ""New York Times"" Best Seller list for 158 weeks, and touched the lives of thousands. One of them was Oprah Winfrey, who devoted two whole episodes of her show to the book. I admit that I haven't read it, but I have done a little research on it and on Gilbert herself. I have to say, I don't much care for her or her story. Her journey of discovery, paid for by an advance on a novel she plans to write, seemed awfully selfish, for she had no real absences in her life; she was married, had an education, was a successful writer, and lived comfortably in New York. This wasn't enough for her?The film ""Eat Pray Love,"" which adapts Gilbert's story and has her portrayed by Julia Roberts, tells us that no, it wasn't enough. She divorces her husband (Billy Crudup), who, in an early divorce settlement scene, gave me more reason to side with him than with her. She has an affair with an attractive and all-around nice young actor (James Franco), which she then ends in a brazen display of tears brought on by God knows what. She then decides that it's time to take a year off and travel the world, to reconnect with herself, to once again have a zest for life - in other words, to escape from all the good things she had but never appreciated. She proceeds to spend four months in Italy, where she happily eats as much pasta and pizza as she can, with a few Napoleons on the side. She then spends the next four months in an Indian ashram, where the tries her hand at meditation, apparently under the impression that God can be grasped in one fell swoop. Finally, she goes to Bali, where she's presented with, but not necessarily willing to accept, love.Along the way, she just happens to meet a number of people. Never mind the fact that they all greatly impact her life, as such people tend to do in stories like this; it's a miracle they can all speak fluent English. One of them, wouldn't you know it, just happens to be from the great state of Texas. In Italy, she befriends a sassy Swede and a charming Italian, a couple who look like they stepped out of a Giorgio Armani ad. In India, she meets the Texan (Richard Jenkins), a loveably gruff old man whose every line sounds like it originated from a fortune cookie. He, of course, has his own tragic back story, although he only shares it at just such a time when it's most convenient for the plot. In Bali, she reunites with the obligatory wise elder (Hadi Subiyanto), the long suffering divorcee (Christine Hakim), and Felipe (Javier Bardem), who enters her life as men tend to do in most forgettable romantic comedies.There's nothing about this movie that feels authentic, and that's what infuriates me; it has the gall to pass itself off as an autobiography. I don't care how accurate Elizabeth Gilbert claims it is (she said during a ""Good Morning America"" interview that it played like a ""surreal home movie""). I don't believe her. This is the stuff of movies, not real life. Besides, she didn't visually document her journey at all - not a single photo, not a frame of film. All the more reason not to believe her. With so much doubt about the story's authenticity, and with Gilbert's questionable dismissal of the good life she so clearly had before making the journey, the film lacks any sense of spiritual enlightenment or emotional awakening; it comes off as little more than a portrait of a selfish woman on a sightseeing trip.Julia Roberts is a wonderful actress, and even though I disliked the woman she played, I still thought she gave a good performance. Javier Bardem seems to be channeling the same dashing mystique he employed in the much, much better ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" which is to say he seems to be repeating himself, albeit competently. As for James Franco, let's just say that my mother has coined the perfect phrase for actors that display no range and speak in monotone lulls: ""They've just gotten a Novocain enema."" I don't know what director Ryan Murphy told him, but whatever he said, it was terrible advice. Franco is usually a very reliable, very convincing actor. Ever seen ""Milk""? Hell, ever seen ""Spider-Man""?""Eat Pray Love"" is phony, contrived, and unpleasant, made worse by the fact that we're supposed to take it as fact. Don't bother sending me comments that I'm wrong and that everything in the film comes directly from Gilbert's actual experiences. I'm not going to believe you. If the filmmakers had followed the leads of the people behind ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and ""Letters to Juliet,"" who had the decency to label their films as works of fiction, then maybe I would have appreciated it more. But then again, no, I wouldn't have; there's still the matter of Elizabeth Gilbert, whose quest for meaning and happiness was really an exercise in trendy New Age mantra-talk and selfishness. The more I think about the journey she made, the less I like her as a person.",Eat Pray Love

320207,"I first caught this 1979 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's early classic ""The Lady Vanishes"" when I was a child. Even back then, I was a huge movie enthusiast and I found the experience to be pleasant, if not particularly substantial. It had its share of amusing moments, but it was not something that I wanted or needed to watch again. However, after a few decades and a lifetime of experience, I thought it might be worth giving this one a second look. The unlikely pair of Elliott Gould and Cybill Shepherd headline this piece, and it is quite fun to see them at a much different time in their careers. Note that I said ""fun,"" I did not say ""good."" Now I'm not a purist that contends that there can't be genuinely worthwhile remakes. There can. In fact, the relatively lightweight ""The Lady Vanishes"" seems an ideal candidate for an updating. Going for a distinctly different tone, however, the film underplays the mystery and the ambiguity to focus on over-the-top antics and manic characterizations. This may be to your liking or not. Personally, I found that when Gould and Shepherd played the entire film with such broad and big personas that it became genuinely tiresome. Though well made, the film falters with these lead performances that play to the rafters at every opportunity.Shepherd is a much married American heiress and Gould a skeptical magazine photographer. Although set in the thirties, you won't believe these two are anything but a product of the seventies! A partially inebriated Shepherd boards a train en route to London. She is given a helping hand from a kindly nanny (well played by Angela Lansbury). When she awakens, however, Lansbury is nowhere to be found and no one admits to having even seen her. Aided by Gould, she embarks on a mission to find out what is going on. Is everyone trying to cover up Lansbury's very existence? Or might she just have been a figment of Shepherd's imagination. As this version lacks mystery, the psychological angle is not very developed and falls a bit flatter than the original. They get added assistance from a kindly doctor played by great character actor Herbert Lom. As they push toward the truth, secrets are revealed and a danger escalates. The plotting is amusing enough, if not particularly believable, but many of the supporting players offer genuine humor.First, let me acknowledge that the movie looks great. The Austrian countryside is lovely and Shepherd's gown (she never has a costume change) is revealing. Lom is terrific as are many of the other actors that inhabit smaller parts. Lansbury makes a mark, but is seen all too briefly. The tone, as I mentioned, is lightweight with much of the action confined to the train. What all but derails the picture (I used a train metaphor) are those lead performances. Gould is hammy, but game enough. Trust me, this doesn't headline his resume! Shepherd really doesn't carry the picture well. Before her fans get in an uproar, let me tell you that I am a big Cybill Shepherd fan. Her line readings, though, are flat and off putting. When not sleepwalking, she overcompensates. I'm all for making this a funnier and lighter version, but the sight of Shepherd and Gould performing slapstick simply wears out its welcome. Interesting as a curiosity factor, but not something you'll want to revisit. KGHarris, 7/13.",N/A

I bought the complete set because I'm rather a completist.  Besides, I kinda think that Episode III: ""The Revenge of the Sith"" is an important introduction to the rise of Darth Vader.What's more, even though Episodes: I, II, and III were the newest films, I think the earlier three (Episodes: IV, V, and VI) look better on film because they don't have all that pasty look of computer graphics.  Compare Jabba The Hut on ""The Phantom Menace"" and look at him (it) again on ""The Return of the Jedi.""  In ""The Return of the Jedi"", Jabba the Hut looks more realistic.

Yoda looks better as an actor with make-up than he does as pasty looking CGI.So anyway, again I ask: ""Who would bother to buy just the prequel?""

1287538,"Mary Horowitz (Sandra Bullock) is a crossword puzzle constructor for a local newspaper. A virtual paragon of knowledge, Mary lives for nothing more than work and her bits of useless trivia, unloading her knowledge to all who will listen. Steve (Bradley Cooper) is a camera man working with television reporter Hartman Hughes (Thomas Hayden Church) for the local CCN news channel. When Mary's parents and Steve's parents set them up on a blind date, Steve doesn't have a great time and ends the date early while Mary sees him as the one and pursues him across the country.In 2009, Sandra Bullock had a red letter year at the movies. She started off the year with the romantic comedy The Proposal which became the highest grossing movie of her career. Later in the year she starred in The Blind Side which not only passed the $200 million to topple The Proposal as Bullock's highest grossing movie, but also proved that she truly had star power as her name was the sole star name on the marquee and has given the starlet Oscar buzz almost guaranteeing an Oscar nomination for Best Actress which would also be a career first. Bradley Cooper also had a great year that saw him starring in The Hangover which became the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time, and getting cast in an upcoming A Team remake. With both stars having career years at the movies, you'd think this pairing would make for thrilling cinema.Unfortunately, I'm here to tell you that you'd be wrong. While I don't think this movie is as bad as the critics would tell you (showing up on many critic's worst of the year lists), I have to admit that the movie is not good. The characters in the movie find themselves in positions that are too absurd as the screenplay takes them to places that just don't really seem to fit. Also, the characters are not well written, being either cardboard cutouts of real people, or being too quirky for their own good. Sandra Bullock comes off the worst. While her acting is not bad, the character is too hapless, too unconvincing with too many quirks that leave you wondering how this woman survived this long in the modern world. The movie also tries to hard to make a statement about following the ""right road,"" being true to yourself, while also being a satire of sensationalist news coverage. The result is a climax that doesn't feel true to the tone of the rest of the movie while also being so sweet and sentimental that you'll find yourself in a diabetic coma by the movie's end.If there is a good point to this movie it's the news crew sent out by CCN to report on occurrences where no one else is available comprised of Steve, Hartman Hughes, and Angus (Ken Jeong). If they would have been played by any other actors they wouldn't have been so fun to watch, but their comedic timing is such that even at their most unlikable they still come across as fun to watch and make you feel that the movie should have revolved around them. They're playful jokey banter with each other, and hapless pranks that essentially drive the plot of the movie accentuates the type of the bromance love that we've been seeing in movies lately. While not the best written material, the actors play it well, and for that I have to give them props.On a certain level I can slightly recommend this movie, but on another level I cannot. It can be fun at times, and at other times it can be beyond ridiculous. If you're looking for a chuckle here or there and mindless entertainment you can probably get over my issues with the film (although Mary might still grate on your nerves a bit), but if you want more than I suggest you look for it elsewhere.2/5",All About Steve

I equally adore Rene Russo and Julianne Moore. Brosnan is tops on my list. So what could be bad? Hah! What's bad is what the actors were given to work with. The script - the narrative - what were the writers thinking? The direction is abysmal - shame on you, Peter Howitt. This film gives new meaning to the word ""fluff."" It's beyond marshmallow.

No? Julianne Moore just doesn't have the right stuff to pull-off comedy. Her tone, her timing, just don't make for laughs. Now, as a serious dramatic actress, she's excellent. But, Ms. Moore, no more forays into comedy, please.Moore plays Audrey Miller, a top notch NYC divorce lawyer and Yale graduate, but a dull character. She is plagued by personal insecurities and neuroses due to a lifetime competing with her ever youthful, ever gorgeous mother, (Frances Fisher). Fellow divorce lawyer, Daniel Rafferty, (Brosnan), matches Miller case for case, and actually seems to win more than lose. A relationship is supposed to blossom here, with Audrey fighting commitment all the way. This is where chemistry, or lack of it, moves the movie into the realm of disaster.I might have appreciated ""Laws of Attraction"" more if it were truly terrible. But it is just blah. I must admit, I did watch the entire film because of Pierce Brosnan. But then, I cannot resist him. Not everyone feels this way. This is one to skip.JANA",N/A

893332,"Uwe Boll is often called the Ed Wood of the current film industry.  Compared to the acclaimed Worst Director of All Time, I think Boll's even worse that him.  Ed Wood may not have the budget (or logic) for any of his movies, but his movies are certainly original, or at least have original elements to stand out; can you think of a movie about aliens that raise people from the dead to threaten humanity for peace, or a movie that ended with the scientist fighting an octopus that explodes?  Boll does not have that same creative and ambitious mind, he prefers to take whatever exists in the media (i.e. video games) and defecate all over it.  His first film, ""House of the Dead"", is the bottom of the barrel of awful movies: the plot and characters are dumb, the camera shots are obnoxious awful (yea, let's have every survivor have 360 effect), the action had no substance, and it makes an asinine use of video game footage for scene transitions.  It was an incoherent, immature monstrosity.""Alone of the Dark"" isn't as bad the director's first disemBOLLment, but that's like saying a plate of excrement is better than a mountain-pile of it.  The plot was functional and it ties all the elements together (sans for the last few scenes), and at least Boll toned down the stupid camera effects for this film.  That being said, the camera effects still exist for insubstantial reasons, like the infamous monster shootout in the storage area where the camera pans and moves around like a 3D cartoon or the first-person POV during a walk in the alley when the camera makes sudden motion shifts.  I understand what the film's trying to present in those moments, but those effects aren't necessary; they're so exaggerated, they ended up losing their intended mood.  Boll makes a dubious effect to use these visual aspects for all of his movies; it's like he's trying to be Paul W.S. Anderson, but he doesn't quite understand his style.Everything else is standard Boll badness.  The actors are phoning it in, there's a lot of dragging, the special effects barely rise above those from Sci-Fi original movies, and overall uneventful to sit through.  ""Alone in the Dark"" is a weak effort, not even the director's cut can fix it.  As far what I know about this version (besides the intended framing of 2.35 instead of 1.78), the love scene between Tara Reid and Christian Slater in the original was cut; not like there was anything going on in that love scene, so it wasn't a big loss.",Alone in the Dark

527828,"Nobody watching ""Nutty Professor II:  The Klumps"" could ever doubt either Eddie Murphy's extraordinary talent for comic impersonation nor the ingenious skill of the special effects team that has managed to bring the actor's many characters to fruition on film.  The utterly seamless merging of all Murphy's personas into a single shot is indeed something wondrous to behold.  Unfortunately, no amount of acting or technical expertise can compensate for a weak script - for a comedy is, after all, only as good as its writing.  In the case of ""NP II,"" the writing leaves a great deal to be desired.In many ways, the film's greatest strength turns out, ultimately, to be its greatest weakness.  Murphy is so good at delineating and inhabiting his characters that it is quite understandable that the filmmakers would want to apportion virtually equal time to each and every one of them.  This turns out to be a problem.  For one thing, it manages to dilute the focus of the film's storyline quite frequently.  Time and again, we find the narrative wandering back and forth between unrelated situations.  Just as we become involved in the affairs of one character, we shift over to the quandaries of another.Still, this would be acceptable if the film at least managed to be funny.  It does offer a few laughs along the way, but the film's script rarely rises above the waistline in its humor.  If a joke doesn't deal with a specific body part (and we're not talking about hands, feet and noses here), it probably deals with a bodily function either sexual or scatological in nature.  I have no personal objection to dirty jokes, but when an entire film consists of nothing BUT such jokes, the whole enterprise ultimately becomes tasteless, tedious and unpleasant.  Take heed if you plan on watching this film with your young children (and note that this isn't even the UNCENSORED version!).In terms of acting, Murphy proves once again his phenomenal ability to create characters who are offbeat, individualized and likable.  What a shame that the filmmakers were not able to craft a vehicle commensurate with his talent.",N/A

879330,"I find it amusing that, like the films of ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Christmas with the Kranks"" actually retains the final line of the book on which it's based, John Grisham's ""Skipping Christmas"".  Clearly the filmmakers realized that most people, like me, didn't actually read ""Skipping Christmas"", but glanced at the last line in a bookstore at some point...Yes, this is a mediocre movie.  However, I think the level of vitriol in some of the reviews it has received, both on Amazon and elsewhere, is absurd.  I love Roger Ebert and his books collecting negative reviews, but he reviewed ""Christmas with the Kranks"" as though it were a cultural document of the utmost significance.  It's just a silly holiday movie!One thing I certainly did not like about ""Christmas with the Kranks"" was the sequence of Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis visiting a tanning salon.  People who use tanning salons greatly increase their risk of skin cancer, and I did not appreciate the depiction of this risky behavior on the part of responsible adult characters in a family comedy.  But aside from that sequence, ""Christmas with the Kranks"" is a harmless piece of fun in which it hardly matters if the neighbors are in the wrong (as Ebert alleges), given that everyone teams up in the end anyway.",Christmas with the Kranks

It is indeed very visually pretty; the stark black and white is definitely pleasing to the eye (the opening in particular, the shot of the baby opening the window is just breathtaking).

I like Buscemi, but let's face it, he's a fairly one dimensional actor as he's been recreating Mr. Pink since Reservoir Dogs. I just don't buy this skinny, chain-smoking twerp being a powerful crime boss with his choice of all the best looking women.I've continued to watch but I nearly gave up after the first 2-3 episodes as it appeared to be just another period-piece fashion show full of unattractive characters. Another reason I nearly gave up on the show was the music. OK, we get it, it's 1920. Good God, back off. It is a very cheap & annoying method of conveying the time period of any movie to simply play period music underneath scene after scene, music that has no connection to what's on screen. In 1920, there were no radios or radios stations. And Victrolas were not exactly common. So why does there always seem to be an Al Jolson song playing from the next room in every scene?And the smoking! Buscemi would fall flat if he didn't have his cigarette smoking to fall back on as a prop. He obviously went to the Michael Madsen &#34;cigarette-smoking-as-acting&#34; school. Add the ever-present whiskey glass and you have cheap, tiresome &#34;acting&#34; tools for everyone to use in scene after scene. It's boring. And all the clever stories told by these gangsters every time they have to make a point? Most of these criminals of the time were uneducated cretins who could hardly put a sentence together let alone a wordy story full of colorful meatphors and the ultimate clever point. These were sociopaths and psychopaths, not Walt Whitman or Hawthorne.What ultimately made The Sopranos so special was the lead character, Tony Soprano. It sounds odd, but Tony Soprano is a psychopath I find funny and likable along with his murderous tendencies. As the lead character in Boardwalk Empire, Nucky Thompson exhibits very little that is likable. As TV psychopaths go, he is simply a mean,  insufferable jerk playing dress-up while he smokes and drinks constantly.And the best actor in the entire series, Michael Shannon, is wasted, IMO, with this bizarre Van Alden character.

Yes, Martin Luther is a fascinating and complex historical figure who challenged corruption, contributed to the Enlightenment, and made a substantial, positive impact on the world. The main and absolutely inexcusable problem here, though, is that in a documentary of an hour and forty-seven minutes, they spent less than one minute addressing the fact that Luther also repeatedly and in no uncertain terms recommended violence against Jews and is arguably the forefather of German anti-Semitism.I am stunned that the Luther-loving ""experts"" completely ignored that ugly fact until a mere thirty seconds tossed into the last ten minutes of the film. I also noticed that the expert who mentioned it was shown just minutes later calling Luther one of the greatest ""emancipators"" of all time. Perhaps. But overall, the editing and interviews in this documentary horribly whitewash Luther's flaws and generally portrays him as compassionate but severe, when the truth (as is often the case) is far more complex and deserving of attention.This documentary needed a Roman Catholic rebuttal (as other reviewers have said) and maybe, I dunno, at least one or two of the other Luther-lovers acknowledging the fact that, yes, the guy also encouraged his followers to burn down synagogues.

The film is an outdated romantic farce about how a son of a succesful tycoon(Marlon Brando) finds a beautiful stowaway in the form of Sophia Loren, who he met in China and now finds aboard a ship with him. A romance develops, though you won't believe it. Obviously, both actors are excellent but are VERY miscast and add to the discomfort of viewing the picture as a whole.Brando cannot seem to capture the nuances of romantic/screwball comedy and is totally out of league in a role clearly intended for a Cary Grant, David Niven or even a Rock Hudson. His character comes across as cold and unfunny throughout and never gains audience sympathy.Loren looks gorgeous, like usual,but seems out of place in the role of the naive Countess.

Clear, with no hiccups.The movie itself....Some have said that this was a 'Coming of age' kind of storyline, that it was more about the boy and his difficult life, than the man named Mud. Yes, the film did focus on the boy more, but it equally focused on Mud and his hard life. The acting was superb. The cinematography was at times beautiful, as well as dark and gritty. The soundtrack was very, very subtle, allowing the viewer to hear the surroundings, making it even more realistic. For parents and those concerned about the rating: There are no nude scenes. No sex scenes. Yet there is a boat-load of foul language. No 'F' bomb that I heard, yet within the first 10 minutes of the film I counted 9 'S' words alone; after counting to 15 I stopped keeping track, and a slew of other foul words just kept on from there. It was just too much foul language, and really not needed. Also quite a bit of gun violence, with people being shot at close range. Boys fighting each other, a grown man punching a boy in the face. Sex references, including porn magazines, and references to girls breasts.Spoiler Alert....For me this movie can be summed up in one word, tragic. No happy endings here. Ellis the boy ends up with the life he didn't want. His father ends up with the life he didn't want. When you start to care about Mud, you then learn that his trials were all for nothing and in the end he doesn't learn a thing. You are lead to care about Mud's girlfriend Juniper, only to dislike her later. The characters seem to be thrown together at which point they all experience tragedies and hard times, then they all sort of go their own way, and life goes on with no one really happy (or caring) about anything. Two hours of unhappiness, dirt, violence, and foul language.",N/A
1213525,"The genre of person-who-talks-to-ghosts is a very fertile one, producing numerous good movies with a range of approaches.  I expected a story with twists that fed off of Gervais' persona (put-upon, exasperated, sarcastic)--an approach under-represented in this genre.  Instead it was mundane and forced (and sappy).  Elements of the formula that could have yielded great comedy were so compressed that they became sterile.A scene with SNL's Kristen Wiig  was promising.  Even though I am not a fan of her style, she and Gervais playing off each other was the type of thing I expected (and wanted).  I expected Aasif Mandvi's character to flow from his ""Daily Show"" persona, but here his role was a generic one and used none of his talents (beyond basic acting).The alternative would have been a movie that didn't attempt to have an actual story but used the genre as a vehicle for extended riffs by the comedian(s) (example, the Hope and Crosby ""Road movies"").  Instead, this movie fell in between, having neither enough story nor enough Gervais (the persona).",N/A

I'm not sure if I'd say it was believable, but it was certainly a sweet effect.Julianna Margulies and Gabriel Byrne are in the movie - definite plus!!  Some of the ghosts were kind of cool, including the little girl and the sexy young singer.The movie does have some decent scenes, but overall it was lacking the uneasy or eerie feeling a haunted place would have.  This is a MUST for any ghost story.  Without it, everything is just bland.Plus the ending lacked imagination....or rather they tried to throw in a twist, but it just wasn't an interesting one.

931745,"OK, I'm pretty easy going when it comes to this type of film. I never expect too much--I don't expect redeeming value, I don't expect character development, I don't expect great acting. Heck, most of the time--I don't even expect much of a story. Having caught Alexandre Aja's effective remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" I was more than willing to give this French (but poorly dubbed) entry in the slasher genre a chance. Well, now, I'm not really sure if it was worth it.The film has a pretty standard setup. Some have already noticed its similarity to Dean Koontz's ""Intensity,"" which is apt--but that, too, already followed pretty conventional guidelines. As two girls are staying in a desolate family home of one of them, a rural madman comes a knocking. Jumping right into a brutality and unpleasantness, various members of the family are dispatched and/or attacked. One girl manages to elude the madman while the other is taken captive. The film has plenty of effectively tense moments during the ""house"" sequence. It sets itself up as a nasty bit of brutality, but nothing particularly original.Intent on helping her friend, the free girl rides with and/or chases the kidnapper's van for the remainder of the picture. Things get a bit sillier, but it is what it is. You know you're just biding time until the final confrontation. Again, I know there is an audience for this--but as our heroine never displayed much ingenuity, she wasn't really someone I cared about. Mainly the film is ""Hide and Seek"" followed by ""Hide and Seek"" with more ""Hide and Seek"" after that--Not a lot of diversity, I guess I'm saying.Now, then, in the last 15 minutes--the surprise twist is unveiled. I have seen this device used in countless other movies, and it can be a tremendous revelation. But not here. Had it been done with any sort of logic, it might have enhanced the film. I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say that a perfectly detailed film is needed to pull it off. A film where this device is used must be a thing of precision. ""High Tension"" just isn't that movie. The twist here makes sense in the context of the picture, however it is not logically supported by what has transpired. For anyone who thinks it is ingenious, I'd like to sit down, have a cup of coffee, and list the dozens and dozens of inconsistencies that just don't work. That said, it irritated me more than anything. What was going to be a 3 star review for derivative unpleasantness with some chills turned into about 1 1/2 stars for being nonsensical.

1143360,"I sat down to this movie with anticipation, knowing nothing but the trailers and thinking it was going to be an uplifting story of lovers separated by war, and the cinematography evidenced in the previews and trailers had convinced me it would be a real treat.Well the cinematography is gorgeous and all the other period effects wonderful. The acting too, is not bad, and for the first fifteen minutes I watched in happy anticipation. Then the rot set in. The storyline took a tremendous dip, from which it never recovered.  Suffice to say there's nothing uplifting about this story, and the only characters in it who enjoyed the least success and attainment of life's goals were the ones who least deserved it. I'm really not a great fan of bait and switch ads in movies, where a movie purports to be one thing, and when you come to see it, it's quite another. Obviously they didn't feel they could sell the story as it was.  I also couldn't believe the premise of the story, that it required at least two people to be so completely without conscience, not just for a moment, but through horrendous consequences, and that Cee was so ineffectual that she couldn't have explained the situation or got at at least one of the accusers to get to the truth.  Even the end of the movie has a twisting deception as to the outcome laid out in the middle, so to speak, so it's not just the previews that were misleading. On the whole, if you like movies that both deceive and concern deceivers, this is the movie for you. If you're looking for something more positive, stay away.",N/A
1553799,"Now, before you get all excited, yes this is a concert from the Kinks from 1965 like the title implies. Every other thing that could go wrong with this title pretty much does, so beware. There are quite a few other Kinks titles on DVD, and I would collect those before picking up this one. This title would be for the diehard collector, or completists only.This is a fullscreen black and white presentation with a pretty awful picture, with lots of pixilation. The audio is in mono, and the vocals (And sometimes the crowd noise) are mixed way up front. Considering the age of the concert though, it's probably lucky that the source survives at all. Sometimes the vocals don't match up with the singers lips on screen, but again, that's probably going to happen with an almost fifty year old concert film. There are no bonus features on the disc at all, and probably most disappointing is the fact that the whole DVD runs only twenty minutes. So, like I said before, this should be for collectors and completists only. Let's find out about the Kinks up to this 1965 show, and then I'll give the DVD tracklisting.WikipediaThe Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Ray and Dave Davies in 1964. Categorised in the United States as a British Invasion band, the Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era. Their music was influenced by a wide range of genres, including rhythm and blues, British music hall, folk and country. Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) remained members throughout the group's 32-year run. Original members Pete Quaife (bass guitar, vocals) and Mick Avory (drums and percussion) were replaced by John Dalton in 1969 and Bob Henrit in 1984, respectively. Dalton was in turn replaced by Jim Rodford in 1978. Keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band during studio sessions in the mid-1960s. Later, various keyboardists, including John Gosling and Ian Gibbons, were full-time members.The Kinks first came to prominence in 1964 with their third single, ""You Really Got Me"", written by Ray Davies. It became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.The Kinks' first single was a cover of the Little Richard song ""Long Tall Sally"". Bobby Graham, a friend of the band, was recruited to play drums on the recording. He would continue to occasionally substitute for Avory in the studio and play on several of the Kinks' early singles. ""Long Tall Sally"" was released in February 1964, but despite the publicity efforts of the band's managers, the single was almost completely ignored. When their second single, ""You Still Want Me"", failed to chart,Pye Records threatened to annul the group's contract unless their third single was successful.""You Really Got Me"" was released in August 1964, and, boosted by a performance on the television show Ready Steady Go!, quickly reached number one in the United Kingdom. Hastily imported by the American label Reprise Records, it also made the Top 10 in the United States.The loud, distorted guitar riff-achieved by a slice Dave Davies made in the speaker cone of his Elpico amplifier (referred to by the band as the ""little green amp"")-gave the song its signature, gritty guitar sound.Extremely influential on the American garage rock scene, ""You Really Got Me"" has been described as ""a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal"". Soon after its release, the group recorded most of the tracks for their debut LP, simply titled Kinks. Consisting largely of covers and revamped traditional songs, it was released on 2 October 1964, reaching number four on the UK chart.The group's fourth single, ""All Day and All of the Night"", another original hard rock tune, was released three weeks later, reaching number two in the United Kingdom,and number seven in the United States./WikipediaThe track list on the DVD are as follows:1.Bye Bye Johnny2.Louie Louie3.You Really Got Me4.Got Love If You Want It5.Long Tall Shorty (Cuts off near end)6.All Day And All Of The Night (Missing the first half of the song)7.You Really Got Me8.All AboardOnce again, this may be a hard to find show, but the shoddy presentation, lack of extras, and terrible picture quality leave this release in strictly collectors territory. 5/10.",N/A
295817,"You have to wonder what goes on in the alcohol and drug addled brains of Hollywood producers that compel  them to re-make classic films. I mean, why not re-make terrible films and turn them into classics. Instead, Hollywood producers take classics and produce terrible re-makes? This brings us to Robin Hood. The 1938 version with Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, et al is a classic.There will never be a better Robin Hood, a more gracious Marion, nor a better group of merry men. Variations on a theme, like ""Men in Tights"" and ""Robin and Marion"" are welcome additions/extensions, but why on earth would you try to re-make the original?That brings us to the 1991 TV movie ""Robin Hood"", starring Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman, with Jurgen Prochnow as the bad guy. Now there's nothing wrong with Patrick Bergin who's given us good performances in ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" (1991), ""Frankenstein"" (1992), and several other films. But he's no Errol Flynn. Bergin is clumsy with a sword, can barely run, much less fly around on ropes and vines, and his moustache is far too well groomed to be a guy living in a cave.21 year old Uma Thurman is cute as a button. This was her 7th film and her first starring role. She went on to bigger and better things (""Pulp Fiction"", ""Kill Bill""), and while her performance is certainly adequate, she has neither the beauty nor the class of Olivia de Havilland. Of course, few actresses do or did.Jurgen Prochnow is a joke as the evil Frenchman. His accent, when he remembers to use it,  was stolen from an old Peter Sellers movie, and Prochnow too appears clumsy and slow footed, a comic parody of the sleek, villainous Basil Rathbone who dueled with Flynn in several movies, but none better than in Robin Hood. Prochnow is a good actor (""Das Boot"", ""Dune"", ""Air Force One""), but this must stand as one of his worst performances.There isn't really much to say. The photography is adequate; there is a musical score; there are a host of merry men, but none of them are notable, and Edward Fox's brief cameo as King John looks as painful to Fox as it is to us.There is absolutely no reason to see this film. Go back to the original, or take a look at ""Robin and Marion"". No other Robin Hood film really merits our attention.BTW - several reviewers have commented on the ""historical accuracy"" of this film. Duh! It's a legend guys! There was no Robin Hood.

1370064,"""The Bisbee Cannibal Club"" is an extremely low budget attempt at a comedy, and there are, to be certain, moments that almost made me laugh. But that's really the best I can say for this film.The story involves the discovery by a group of Bisbee, Arizona, locals that there is an organized group of cannibals in the town. The locals form a group to fight against the cannibals (who, by the way, prey only on vegetarians). With this set-up, the film is mostly slapstick, albeit at times gory slapstick. There is a scene, for example, in which one of the cannibals is being chased. He runs past an empty pizza box, stops, goes back to the box, and looks inside in hope of food. That scene was mildly amusing. On a similar level were the multiple bat-to-the-head strikes that were somewhat amusing, though I'm not sure they were intended to be so.The end result is a film that is not especially funny, not in the least bit frightening, and not quite bad enough to make watching the entire thing unbearable.

67697,"It seems like my opinion on this film will differ from everyone else's, but if we all agreed, how fun would that be?Right from the opening scene, we're meant to be impressed with the camcorder image of a teenage  girl talking sullenly about murdering her  &quot;geek boy father&quot;.  Cut next to the Father, who announces that he will be dead a year from now  -- he intones this while doing something unmentionable  (on Amazon)  in the  shower.  Flashy enough for you?  When the story lacks substance, wow them  with  &quot;cleverness&quot;.  And this story, folks, does indeed lack  substance:  making middle-aged suburban angst into art is beyond even the  most scrupulous talents, I daresay.  Therefore, we're submitted to weird  tricks such as rose petals cascading from a cheerleader's blouse.  Not only  does this cheap trick waste time, it's dishonest:  why can't we see what  the Spacey character is REALLY thinking about?  In my opinion, the roses  thing is a cop-out; the film lacks the courage of its convictions; but who  wants a NC-17 rating?  No theaters screen NC-17 films, and NC-17 films  never win Oscars.Kevin Spacey, despite using all his Kevin-Spacey-Shtik  (droll expressions, world-weary murmur, et al.), is the character we most  care about, but, as I'm intimating, no thanks to him.  Considering the  ponderous denouement, his facile interpretation isn't really called for --  we need a more serious performance.  The other characters are cartoons:  The Termagant Wife, the Spooky Teenager  (there are several), the Repressed  Homosexual.To finish: despite its slick attempt at  &quot;sophistication&quot;, e.g., the Floating Trash Bag, the Rose Petals,  the Voice from the Grave, this is a very mainstream tale told in a  surprisingly average way.  Besides all that, the actors chew the scenery  (Bening's blubbering, Spacey snapping his wrists as he hands over a bag of  burgers).

786704,"Based on Peter Driscoll's 1972 novel, this film is set in apartheid 1970-ish South Africa during the origins of anti-apartheid groups like the Black Congress movement, seeking to overthrow  the government to achieve self-determination for the country's 18 million blacks (versus 3 million ruling whites).One always has to wonder about films where the viewpoint is so one-sided with few shades of grey.  This film treads a fine line indeed between politically correct propaganda and a wheels-within-wheels conspiracy thriller.  This reviewer's initial fears that the propaganda element would overwhelm other considerations diminished when the plot took some unexpected twists and ended with a flourish.Sidney Poitier is moderately successful in his characterization of a black who has been subdued and imprisoned by the contemptuous and repressive apartheid regime.  Years of forced subservience (and his survival of them) have made his external persona almost stoic.  Yet behind this apparent stoicism, he seethes with hatred and works for the total destruction of the apartheid system.  Opening the film, the authorities mysteriously release him from prison.  The mystery compounds when the authorities fail to re-arrest him despite any number of infractions (trumped-up or otherwise), choosing rather to follow him.A young Michael Caine plays - Michael Caine, dragged in by accident for the ride and implicated by events.  The other performances are routine excepting Major Horn (Nicol Williamson) and his side-kick Van Heerden (Ryl De Gooyer), as the arrogant, menacing and sadistic pursuing agents from the Bureau of State Security.  These two never miss an opportunity to threaten and denigrate those who either cross their path or try to frustrate their curious agenda.  Despite their limited screen time, Wiliamson and De Gooyer nevertheless bring something extra to their portrayals.The original 1974 cinematography was apparently quite good, as the (Kenya) scenery is beautiful.  The DVD picture is sufficient for enjoying the film; but purists will notice that it is fuzzy and the colors are washed out, so no re-mastering or other significant picture restoration was attempted.  Sound is in the same category.  The DVD keep case is fine.  Be advised the film is mostly for Caine or Poitier collectors.  For others it is little more than a couple hours' entertainment.",N/A

I sympathize with Mr. Colbert.  I'd buy and watch anything Clive Owen has done, even that series of high-octane BMW commercials he did back in 2001 and 2002.  There's something about his snarly amiability, his capacity to take the conventionally wry Leading Man attitude and give it a dose of sheltered vulnerability that plays like snarky ambivalence.  But mostly I just want him to hold me.Ha ha ha.  Eh.  Okay, well, all of that having been said, this movie?  Not very good.""Derailed"" is, indeed, a clever little thriller, but it's too big for its britches.  The story sprawls so much that its contrivances seem awkward, and its twists seem more like flow-stopping kinks.  Penned by Stuart Beattie after the man had already given us ""Collateral"" and the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Derailed"" lacks the tight plotting and character-driven nuances of either of those movies.Our story follows a fellow named Charles Schine (Clive Owen) who chances to meet a lovely stranger named Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) on his train ride to work.  The two flirt with that sort of soft-toned abrasiveness that comes so easily to the executives of the World of Moviedom (both Schine and Harris' jobs are your typically ill-defined filmic pablum; what they do never matters as much as the fact that its lucrative).  Before they know it, they're slumming it in a moth-eaten motel room and gettin' it on, as they say.Unfortunately, the only one who gets it off, as they say, is the guy who breaks into their room, robs them, and then does unspeakable things in the interim.  The encounter is, indeed, hard to watch, stomach-churning, even if the robber (Vincent Cassel packing his chops with as much cheese as he can) keeps uttering the sort of unimaginative drivel that most movie villains utter in the midst of their bad behavior.  Ah, but can I blame a low life like this for being uncreative?Yes, I can, actually.  Our low life, LaRoche, is actually pretty smart, because the hotel room is just the beginning.  LaRoche, realizing he's attacked a couple of very soft, very wealthy targets, cranks things up a notch, turns the screws, puts the pressure on, ups the ante, hits close to home, ADD METAPHOR HERE.What really ruins ""Derailed"" is its schizophrenic pacing.  Owen is at his greatest when his character has reached an interlude, when a decision must be made.  You can see the dark calculus of his thoughts on his well-angled face, and when he reaches his conclusion, the actions he takes are just an extension of those ruminations.  However, in ""Derailed,"" those moments seem to last forever.  Furthermore, Owen's character is so stupid, so weak, and so spineless, it's hard, by the end, to care what happens to him and his wife and his Dying Daughter (who could be cured by a miraculous new drug that costs as much as Tanzania, apparantly, and for which the Schine's have been saving for seven years; this is known as an Emotional Plug-in).It's great that Owen plays against type in this movie; I'm not faulting him for that.  I am, however, faulting the film for the character it has chosen to place at its center.  Schine's transgressions are understandable, I suppose, and so is his habit of burying all of his problems under a pile of money.  But his actions at the end, the logical leaps he makes in the interim, it's all choreographed inconvenience.  From the cops who inexplicably berate him for not buying a hooker, to LaRoche's perpetually-scowling partner-in-crime (Xzibit, who uses the same facial expression in every frame of the film), to Schine's mail boy, Winston Boyko, an ex-con who still steals from time to time and even has, as a keepsake, the first shiv he ever used to stab someone with (played with companionable charm by RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan): it's all hokey and eye-rolling.Of course, the entire movie would fail to exist if Schine would do the one sensible thing and go to the cops, but the script takes great pains to explain why he shouldn't, wouldn't, and doesn't do this.  I never really bought it.  In fact, the further along the film went, the less I bought.  Too much of the movie tries to be clever, tries to circle around into itself.  Its a pile of plot-threads, a tangled mess of consequences and coincidences, and even the great Clive Owen can't save it.But he can still hold me whenever he wants.",N/A

When there was also this commentary about this movie being a mish mash of Jaws, Matrix, Crouching Tiger, I thought to myself this movie has got potential.  I have always expected French movie to be a bit out of this world but then again, there is a word to describe it, flair~  Anyhow, when the movie started, it definitely showed a glint of promise, with those slow motion cinematography, hinting slowly at John Woo style, & with the ocassional multi angle Matrix style fighting style.

The main characters looked very much like Christopher Lambert in his heydays & his brother, an Iroquois was none other than the actor who played the TV series, the Crow.  Towards the end of the movie, the style became looser & looser & the plot also became incoherent.  The killing style was more fitting to a mish mash of From Dusk Till Dawn (Quentin Taratino style), Bollywood style movies with a dash of HK style kung-fu movies.  Anyway, you can probably describe this movie as an international effort, or probably you can say that this movie is also trying to be Jack of all trade but as you know how the saying goes, and the master of none.  Naturally, Monica Belluchi from Malena was underutilised here.  Other than displaying her voluptuous body, her role as a high class prostitute & working for the Pope to investigate the mystery of the monster which devoured people here were questionable.  A movie worth watching for a good laugh and not necessarily for its quality.  Should this movie is really the highest gross movie in France, obviously, the audience tends to differ from my opinion",N/A

740183,"...and by God was I right!(See my review on the Philosopher's Stone)What has happened in the time between the two Harry Potter movies? Hmmm..  Ah! yes of course! The Lord of the Rings has happened! And did they have this amazing, over-the-top achievement in CGI, called ""the Gollum""? Yes sir, they did! And who was the first to shamelessly ""borrow"" the idea and bring it in their own movie? Chris Columbus and Co. for their next HP adventure of course.I have to admit that this movie is a lot better than the first one. But that does not qualify for a good movie in general.Borrowing a lot of elements from the horror genre, this one hopes to bring some chills to the children of the globe with the amazing MPAA looking completely the other way.The story? ok,  let's see....Marty and Doc, oops sorry, Harry and Ron, climb on their flying car, to Hogwarts school, even after being advised not to, by a poorly executed Gollum impersonation. There, they stubmle upon a murdering beast that is set loose in the school, controlled by an evil entity which also controls an innocent student to... ... ...set loose and control the beast.(?)The evil entity is using somebody else's body to do it's dirty deeds, much like (well the first that comes to mind) Freddy Krueger in Nightmare 2. This entity lives in a book and is risen when the book was read aloud.... Something of an Evil Dead kind of pilosophy.It could actually be ok, if the ""borrowing"" stopped there.But...Let's not forget Star Wars, our main influence.The Quiddich game, this time a little more elaborate, is an almost exact copy of the forrest chase in ""Return of the Jedi"", Leia on the Speeder-Bike and the Stormtroopers chasing her. And of course, the Hint of a love game, between NOT him that has the power, but the goofy sidekick, and the girl. At least in Star Wars they were siblings (Luke and Leia). What explanation is mrs. Rowling going to give for Ron and Hermione... who knows (I refuse to read the books.)One of the major scenes in the movie includes a gigantic spider, much like ""Shelob"" of the LOTR, which did not make the final cut of the ""Two Towers"" and was reserved for the ""Return of the King"". The spider is almost named ""Aragorn"", ha ha!!My 9 year old daughter remarked that the head of the giant snake, came right out of Jurassic Park's T-Rex. (She is 9 for christ's sake!)And last but not least... the great climax scene...I think it was the ""Nightmare on Elm Sreet 3"", where the school teacher went to the place they had buried Freddy's Skeleton, he had a fight with it, and then, when Nancy lay unconcious in front of the grave, he sprayed Holy Water on it, and the real Freddy burst in rays of pure light.Hmmmm..... Jenny unconcious... the book.... the fang... bursts of light.... make the connection?I give up. No more for this one...To be continued.... (it always does...)",N/A
1388547,"""Pregnancy Pact"" is another Lifetime Channel movie that straddles the uneasy line between well meaning social commentary and lurid melodrama. A ripped from the headlines plot is inspired by the Massachusetts case that received national news coverage involving an extremely high preponderance of high school girls getting (you guessed it) pregnant. The real life story was, without doubt, fascinating and disturbing. So I held out hope that the hype surrounding the actual circumstances might elevate Lifetime to produce an accounting of more substance than their usual output. A cast of unknowns--except the A grade talent of Thora Birch, Nancy Travis, and Camryn Manheim--is stranded with a lackluster and obvious script that hopes to illuminate the issue of teen pregnancy but really just makes everyone seem a bit (or a lot) foolish.The premise, obviously, has some merit being grounded by actual events. And the movie starts out promisingly enough. A school nurse (Manheim) pursues more awareness in the schools after having administered a ridiculously high percentage of pregnancy tests in the preceding year. Unbeknownst to the conservative authority figures, a group of girls are actively seeking to bring babies into the world. One of the primary proponents of an abstinence only education is Travis, but she soon gets blind-sided that her perfect daughter may be caught up in a bigger scandal. Luckily a roving Internet blogger (Birch) is on hand to blow the lid off the story. If it sounds a bit odd to have a blogger doing the legwork--well, it is!It all boils down to expected stereotypes--different factions and different politics--everyone is represented in some rudimentary form. The girls themselves are particularly silly--even villainous as painted by the film. The film really shies away from coming to any sort of real societal conclusions. Instead, we're treated to the melodramatic trappings of generic moralizing. With plenty of music montages, you know that healing and forgiveness can't be far behind. ""Pregnancy Pact"" takes compelling true life drama and whitewashes away any real discussion of the issues for a quick and easy conclusion. But that's really no surprise, is it? KGHarris, 12/10.",N/A

851476,"I don't believe director Antoine Fuqa meant ""King Arthur"" to be a comedy or burlesque. So, why was I laughing ten minutes into the film? The movie, about the Roman departure from Britain in the fifth century, and the subsequent invasion of the Saxon hordes, resembles a Hollywood historical epic extravaganza, circa 1960. The first battle scene did me in. The new bishop from Rome, accompanied by a contingent of mighty Roman soldiers on their way to their base near Hadrian's wall, are attacked by Woads, an army of Pictish freedom fighters in delightful blue body paint. Tattoo artists are going to make a bundle from this film! I watched in disbelief as the primitive Picts, on foot, slaughter the mounted elite Romans. Now these are the forces who conquered most of the known world. I don't think these fighting professionals pick-off more than 6 or 7 natives while they, in turn, are being slaughtered. Tell me that's not a rigged fight! Enter the Sarmatian calvary to the rescue, led by their commander, Artorius/Arthur. Suddenly the seemingly invincible Picts are slaughtered like canon fodder, (which has yet to be invented), by the newcomers. How could the Woads be so good one moment and so bad the next?? Talk about contrived! So, from this violent interaction, I concluded that the Romans were the bad guys, the Sarmatians the good ones, and the Woads indeterminate - because Arthur allows their leader to go free. Now, I loved ""Brave Heart,"" ""Rob Roy"" was a good movie too, as was ""Gladiator."" Although Hollywood spectaculars in nature, these movies were believable enough for me to empathize with the characters. I had something to work with - someone to root for!Not to be picky, but as soon as the various fighting forces begin to parlay I began to giggle. The Sarmatians all have different accents - they sound like representatives from diverse parts the UK, and perhaps Australia. The Romans speak English with heavy Italian accents, and when the Saxons eventually speak their lines, their leader Cerdic, (Stellan Skarsgard) sounds like Joe Cocker with a cold. Their soldiers just grunt, but in different dialects. There must have been a worldwide casting call for this film. This is distracting! The dialogue throughout is too cliched to be campy - are you getting the drift? The plot is too predictable. I did like the idea of a revisionist Arthurian history, but David Franzoni's screenplay destroyed the credibility for me. There are moments of cleverness - but too few and far between. I was, and am, very disappointed.The Sarmatians, from the steppes of Central Asia, were conquered by Rome, and their sons forced as adolescents to join the Roman calvary for a fifteen year period. After rigorous training, a group of these impressed soldiers are stationed, with their leader Lancelot, (Ioan Gruffudd) in Britain, where they hang-out with local women, breed like rabbits, complain about the weather, gamble and fight the Woads, whenever they venture south of the wall. Their commander is Arthur, (Clive Owen), a man of mixed parentage, who was born and raised in Britain, is loyal to Rome, but also staunchly loyal to his men. And the Sarmatians are devoted to him.Arthur's knights - Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), and Gawain (Joel Edgerton) -- are about to return home to their families in Sarmatia after having fulfilled their 15 years of service. Their freedom is to officially begin the day after Bishop Germanius, (Ivano Marescotti), arrives. In this period, just before the Dark Ages, the Catholic Church rules in Rome through the emperor. The villainous prelate forces them to go on one last mission where they see, first-hand, examples of Roman cruelty and the brutality of the Saxon invaders, who are determined to take over where the Roman's leave off. These Nordic warriors show their stuff, amidst many more grunts, roars and bloody hacking during an action-packed battle on ice, which was a highpoint - much better and gorier than the Ice Capades. It is on this mission that they acquire Guinevere, (Keira Knightley), a Woadish nymphet who had been captured and tortured by the Romans in an attempt to convert her to Christianity. She is the cleanest one in the movie, and the prettiest, with a sexy, goth-style wardrobe and pouty lips. As a warrioress, she's good with a bow and arrow, and as a love interest, she sighs her way through love scenes with Arthur.Arthur and his band of merry knights decide to stay and fight for Britain, and join forces with Merlin, (Stephen Dillane), the Woad leader, to expel the Saxons. The rest is not history, nor even legend. Boo!JANA",King Arthur

Personally I found Enid to be despondent wreck, hell bent on lambasting others for their perceived injustices (read: success).  The parade of foil characters that attempted to sharply contrast her persona only reinforced my belief that not only was she clueless and without direction, but that she was simply melnacholy because she did not fit in.  Her acerbic demeanor, lack of depth or any altruistic conviction only proved that she wasn't motivated by a cause or struggle.  My belief is that her perpetual effort to rub popular culture the wrong way was in some way a combative response to not fitting in.  On that level this work was a mild success. Just don't get confused, acting out is not high art.  This piece was a prime example of both the director and the protagonist being rebels without a cause...or clue.",N/A

6116,"Viewing this movie shortly after seeing ""Goodfellas"" and two years worth of ""The Sopranos"" may have been an error on my part.  ""Donnie Brasco"" just isn't as good.  I can't put it in simpler terms.  All of the Sopranos characters are three dimensional, and one develops a certain empathy for them, if not admiration of their values.  They laugh, live, drink, live.  The same for Goodfellas.  There is nothing even two dinensional in Brasco.  Not one of the characters ever breaks from the fake tough guy scowl.The acting isn't the problem.  The movie has a fine cast.  The flaw is in the writing.  For example, the character played by Al Pacino is a petty, small time cog in the mob, from start to finish, with one notable moment.  Brasco doesn't really change much from an FBI agent, trying to pass as a criminal.In short, I just wasn't convinced in the sense that I am convinced by Tony Soprano et al. or by the trio of comrades in arms in Goodfellas.  Perhaps I would have had a higher regard for the subject film if there were not much, much better films about the mob.  Forgettaboutit.",N/A
572742,"This made-for-cable movie is an honest attempt to boil down Jimi Hendrix's life and music down to less than two hours.  Unfortunately the producers were unable to obtain the rights to any of Jimi's songs, so the musical score is entirely made of up his covers (Hey Joe, All Along the Watchtower, Wild Thing, etc.) plus some unattributed jamming.  You get the typical 60s montages (JFK, Malcom X, the Beatles, Dylan, etc.) along with the cookie-cutter dialogue and vastly oversimplified story.Despite some good performances, the script doesn't really offer the scope to examine why Hendrix's music was so revolutionary, or the problems that led to his early death.There's not much fire here, either, as the film suffers from wooden pacing and is never especially absorbing.The documentary film &quot;Jimi Hendrix&quot;, also available on DVD, is a far better way to gain an appreciation of this artist.",Hendrix

1186674,"It finally happened: Peyton and Lucas got married and had a baby girl named Sawyer! To be quite honest, the series ""One Tree Hill"" has lost its touch from WAY too many story lines of having characters fight back and forth over the same things again and again. Brooke (Sophia Bush) continues to fight with her mother Victoria (Daphne Zuniga)in who has control over the ""Clothes Over Bros"" store. She has a continuing relationship with Julian (Austin Nichols) and in the end, tries to make him jealous by having a fling with Nick Lachey from the 90's boy band ""98 Degrees"" and ""adopts"" the rebellious teen Sam Walker (Ashley Rickards). The basketball rebel Quentin Fields (Robbie Jones)life ends suddenly when he is an innocent bystander in a robbery. Nathan (James Lafferty) continues on his neverending quest to become a rising NBA star, (although I don't understand how you can after you shave points in a high school basketball game). Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) gets offered to have his book turned into a movie and finds it hard to cast the actors and actresses to play the people in his life. Peyton (Hilarie Burton)finds out that she might have cancer and the possible risk of it hurting her and her unborn child. Haley (Bethany Joy Galeotti) struggles in her career as a teacher and goes back to her roots as a singer/songwriter. Young Jamie (Jackson Brundage) deals with the sudden death of Quentin, the discovery of Skillz (Antawn Tanner) and his grandmother Deb (Barbara Alyn Woods)hooking up, and understanding the pains of growing up. From this season, I'm still wondering why Dan (Paul Johansson)was kept alive throughout this season even though crazy nanny Carrie (Torrey DeVitto) ran him over and attempted to make him suffer in anyway possible. Overall, this season was hugely disappointing in many levels. These ""Tree Hill"" characters may think they've grown-up but really, they're still trapped in the same high school drama. Hilarie Burton and Chad Michael Murray will not be returning for Season 7 and the producers hope to mix it up with new characters and the setting will be one year into the future.",One Tree Hill: S6 (DVD)
1193737,"I was really psyched about watching this movie. All of the positive reviews on here plus an extremely vocal Blockbuster employee really got me pumped for this British horror flick.Unfortunatly, the movie didn't really work out that well for me.I am a fan of horror films and like any normal fan of the genre, I embrace twists and turns and new ideas...but, Eden Lake, despite it's gorgeously filmed directing and cinematography, left me feeling anything but happy.Having just seen the French thriller THEM, I was not really looking forward to the child-killers angle. I feel like it's a little TOO real and disturbing for cinema. On the flipside of that though, it works because it IS such a visceral and controversial topic. No one wants to think that there children could commit such crimes, but the reality of it is that children, when left to there own devices, can come up with some pretty sick ways to have fun. Eden Lake takes that idea, throws in a gang of young teens, a perky, cute preschool teacher and her attractive fiance and an undeveloped lake property that will soon be a resort and mixes them into a torture flick that DOES entertain...but ultimately lets viewers down.*****************spoilers below***************************The gore: There wasn't a TON of gore as some might have mentioned. I have seen worse. The most effective scenes would be shots of a very realistic looking GAPING stab wound that is pouring blood. It looked very real and very nasty.The torture of the main character is bad, but I have seen worse. There is also some light animal related abuse along with a fairly violent dog death. Some people have said the death of the dog was not bad...but it was actually one of the worst dog deaths I have seen on a film and it was actually pretty sad. The dog wasn't an evil, menacing dog...it was merely the main bullies pet and had a slight barking issue...when the dog ended up stabbed it was an accident and there is some dog crying and yelping that lasts for a bit and we see a few shots of it lying on the ground breating slowly with it's eyes open as the boy yells ""she's dying!"" over and over again...which was very dramatic and upsetting to me, being an animal lover with dogs of my own. So, that said, fair warning to any people who can't watch dogs or pets killed on film. This wouldn't be a good one to see because of that scene.Overall: While I understand the familiarity of killing off every single main character, I felt robbed at the end of this film. Jenny went through so much hell, she was tortured more mentally than anyone would want to go through. Having to kill children to survive was something she had to do to fight and live...but, the ending of this film LITERALLY left me in tears. The raw emotional pull on your heart as you realize what is about to happen to her, after everything she had been through, was devestating. I actually stood up and paced in front of my tv, shaking my head in disbelief. I was highly upset. The injustice of the ending along with the survival of the ""HEAD BULLY""  (who I just wanted to get killed the whole time!!!) was enough for me to want to never see this film again as long as I live.Very upsetting, very disturbing and WAY too much of an emotional rollercoaster for my taste. I dont want to watch a horror movie that makes me want to cry and scream at my tv about injustice and things not being fair. I also don't want to come off as ignorant by playing the ""i wish it had a happy ending"" route. What horror movie TRULY has a happy ending? People have been slashed and killed, so is there really going to be a HAPPY ending? Doesn't make much sense. But, I do like a film that at least has a SURVIVOR. No survivor usually equals a waste of time to me in the long run.So, this film just didn't work for me. I never want to see it again and can only really recommend it to people who can handle truly unhappy endings.",Eden Lake
348406,"The Hidden Fortress is classic Kurosawa, in every way--except for the wild overacting, inane characterizations and lamefooted humor of the peasant pair who form a central element of the film.  Had the peasants been just as grubby but more subdued, or given comic material with more edge, skewering the upper classes as well as themselves, or been less in the focus and operated far in the background, this wouldn't have been a problem.  But instead we're offered a sort of Dumb & Dumber, Beavis & Butthead of Japan, 50 years ago.  (And yes, I know that is anachronistic, but it's all too true.)  ""Stupidity is funny"" wears thin after a short while, and the comic antics are both repetitive and all too easy to forecast.  Oh, here comes a rocky upwards incline: let's watch the pair pull one another down with grotesque facial expressions as they try to scramble up, etc.Which is all too bad, because while the rest of the film has its overblown heroics, its far from bad.  The interactions between cast members has both tension and grit, while the outdoor settings mark a difference from the usual run of Japanese period films (though Kurosawa addicts like myself will well recall what he could do in Roshomon).  Mifune is over the top but splendid, and the direction has energy and focus.I've seen this film twice in 25 years; most recently, just last night, again.

She seemed to improve as a film actor in the last 15 years of her career, she was not at her best here. Using film acting technique more acceptable in the thirties.

1103828,"""Hm, nice package!"", I said while opening the box from Amazon with several DVDs inside. ""I am going to start with this one"".... But what I found inside was really nice package and really painful representation of what I was waiting for to have in a decent form.Right from the start on all the discs come the impressive menus/submenus with embedded bonus materials. ""Good start! Move on!"". Audio commentaries, ability to select the chronological order of tracks - excellent! (5-star review was already being composed in my mind)....But what came next strongly disappointed me. All of the videos in the main body of all three discs are cropped on top and bottom! Well, such butchering is a result of the contemporary marketing rules. The same things happened to the movies when they were cropped on the sides to be released on VHS videos to fit concumer's TV screens. Now we have the opposite situation: what WAS filmed in full-frame and was intended to be screened on 4:3 screens is cropped ""to fit our 16:9 TV sets"". Who cares about the product itself??!! Even letterboxed images are being cropped at a tighter matte, we all know about that, but the result looks very poor. The same thing happened to this promising (at first glance) set.FORTUNATELY, bonus materials are not cropped! So we have London Town, Band on the Run and some other stuff in excellent quality.After I ran through this set I got back to my old amateur dvd-s with the same videos but the picture untouched (well, call them bootlegs, if you like, but they aren't in fact: I got them from people who do not buy or sell stuff, only swap copies). Here when I calmed down. ""No"", - I said,  - ""I won't get rid of you. Here is the real stuff"".One more surprise: I haven't found the Southbank Show bonus on Disc 1, instead there is a piece where Paul is talking about creation of Eleanor Rigby/Eleanor's Dream sequence for Broad Street sessions. If this is a mistake - this is not a bad mistake and I don't complain about that. Or maybe this is my mistake and this IS the Southbank Show? Correct me if I'm wrong.Finally, this is definitely not a complete set of Paul McCartney videos.Resume: an unjustified waste of money?

I seem to go in spurts of movie watching and I am smack in the middle of an episode.  My girlfriend and I don't always agree with our first choices so we settled on Four Christmases as a compromise.  It seemed light hearted and we always like a good laugh.  My first choice was the GI Joe movie but she vetoed that immediately.  I guess I will have to watch that one today while she is out and enjoy it in the quite solitude as I crank the volume on high.Four Christmases is about a man a woman who are living together and are so removed from family feelings they don't even have the desire to get married.  They spend their holidays on various beaches lying to their families so they don't have to venture back home.  Both sets of both parents are divorced so they have in total four houses for Christmas.  As luck would have it their flight gets canceled and they are they get interviewed on TV at the airport.  Their families' view the nightly news and they find themselves stuck seeing all four parents for one Christmas holiday.  Are you stressed yet?  It is difficult seeing one set of parents, it might kill you to see that much family all in one day.As you might expect everyone is the most dysfunctional insane people you might find anywhere on the planet.  I wonder how these two turned out normal at all.  The couple goes through the typical road bump that faces all couples in romantic comedies and they then figure out how to proceed in life.  Ah, isn't it good that everything always works out in the end.It was a little short on common sense and the believability of almost anyone was stretched.  Nobody has that many messed up people in one family.  Somebody needs to be normal to keep the peace.  Laughs were physical acts of babies puking and falling off of roofs.  It just didn't have any depth at all.  I don't have to have much in a movie but give me something.It is not the worst movie I have ever seen and if you are in the mood for a couple of beers beforehand it might make it a little worthwhile.  I can't imagine there not being something better on to watch but if you get stuck in a pinch it won't make you break out in hives.  How is that for a resounding endorsement?Can't recommend this one but to each his own as they say.",Four Christmases (DVD)

Anamorphic widescreen transfers boost the picture resolution to make the movies look closer to it's original theatrical presentation.

747512,"You simply must hand it to the late Joe D'Amato. During his long career in the Italian film business, good old Joe made dozens and dozens of low budget films in genres ranging from pornography to graphic exploitation to extreme horror. ""Emanuelle in America"" is a Joe D'Amato production, as is ""Anthropophagous,"" ""Buio Omega,"" ""Ator,"" and the best ""so bad it's good"" film ever made, ""Troll 2."" Sure, Joe made a lot of clinkers in his time, but what do you expect? D'Amato's films weren't crafted to win Hollywood awards. Most of his movies raked in the bucks in overseas markets, in places where the crowds filling the theater could care less about what type of schlock they're watching. A few of his movies surprisingly appeared on movie screens here in the States; I saw ""Ator"" at the local cinema in the early 1980s. Moreover, and probably most importantly, Joe's films also made money in America when the videocassette craze broke in the early 1980s. Yep, Joe D'Amato is a beloved figure to fans of schlock cinema, horror cinema, exploitation cinema, and anyone else who loves movies that wander far off the beaten path.I should start by saying ""Killing Birds"" isn't a very good film. In fact, it is at times an atrocious piece of junk best relegated to the trash heap of bad cinema. ""Killing Birds"" as a Joe D'Amato film is closer to ""Troll 2"" than it is to ""Buio Omega,"" with important exceptions. Where ""Troll 2"" was hilarious because of its badness, ""Killing Birds"" is decidedly bad in an unfunny way. Imagine, if you will, a story about a Vietnam veteran who returns to his house in the bayous of Louisiana only to find his wife cheating on him with another man. Enraged by this blatant infidelity, the vet goes on a bloody rampage. He kills his wife, her lover, and a couple of neighbors unfortunate enough to appear on the scene. The murderer does, however, spare the couple's young son. For some reason that I still cannot adequately explain, some birds living on the grounds viciously attack the vet, tearing his eyeball out of his head and thus leaving him crippled for life. All of these scenes unfold against the backdrop of lush foliage in one of those stately old mansions you often see in shows about the South. Sounds like a great premise for a horror film, doesn't it? That's what I thought. I was wrong.Flash forward twenty years or so to a college campus where a gaggle of young adults plan an expedition into the bayou to research a biology project, something about the mating call of a rare bird. The group consists of your usual young people in a horror movie. There are a few loudmouths, the scholarly chick, the oversexed cutie, and a few other stock characters. You get the idea. After heading into the wilds of Louisiana, the kids meet a blind guy (Robert Vaughn!) who lives in a rotting mansion. This man spends his days recording the sounds of the wildlife in the area, so he gives the kiddies a few tips about what they seek and then promptly disappears for a large part of the film. Too bad, by the way, because Vaughn is about the only good thing about ""Killing Birds."" Even in the short time he appears onscreen he gets all the best lines, does a competent job with a bad script, and even manages to look and act creepy. Anyway, the young adults head out into the bayou, set up base in an abandoned house, and promptly die in cheesy ways as a host of weird zombies appear on the scene. It's all really lame in the strictest sense of the word, with cheap looking gore effects, bad acting, and dumb dialogue. The movie doesn't end as much as it skids to a halt.Most of the elements we take for granted in other films fail to materialize in this one. The pacing of ""Killing Birds"" is glacial, a molasses like mess that moves with all the speed of a snail on tranquilizers. I didn't just glance at my watch once in awhile with this turkey; I looked at my timepiece so often I developed a serious case of whiplash. I would like to tell you the pacing was the worst part of the film. It's not. Check out the music for this mess. Never, in all my years of watching bad films, have I seen such a schizophrenic score. The scenes at the beginning of the movie, when we meet the kids, employs an interesting (cough) blend of bland pop music that you must simply hear to believe. Pure treacle of the most abysmal sort, like ""Dreamweaver"" but worse to the nth degree. Then, an abrupt change takes place. Maybe D'Amato dug up Jan Hammer to score most of the film because what we hear when the researchers encounter the zombies sounds a lot like ""Miami Vice."" I'm not even going to go into some of the outfits the guys wear in the film. Let's just say I had serious questions about their sexuality. I wonder why the girls in the group didn't have the same thought.I can't give ""Killing Birds"" one star, though. The movie did manage to dredge up some creepy atmosphere in the end, and Robert Vaughn's appearance helped salvage the film. The DVD version is your typical Media Blasters/Shriek Cinema disc: trailers for several other schlock classics, an extended interview with Robert Vaughn about his role in the movie (!), and some other stuff. I cannot recommend this movie without feeling guilty, and I certainly cannot do so to viewers unaccustomed to cheesy movies. Horror fans should steel themselves for an unpleasant experience before popping this one in the DVD player. All others need to stay away. Far, far away.",Zombie 5: Killing Birds

This lasts for much of the rest of the movie, with only five or ten minutes in the end consisting of a reasonably decent combat sequence.

1320700,"Part of After Dark Horrorfest 4, Kill Theory (2009) directed by Chris Moore, features a twisted variation of the kill or die scenario, when a group of friends is forced to turn on each other.  Once set in motion, events play out dramatically and violently, though not very credibly, as the characters demonstrate few critical thinking skills, and a fair amount of treachery.The instigator of the mayhem is a fellow named Walter (Kevin Gage) who to save his own life while mountain climbing, cut a rope that sent three of his friends to their deaths.  Tried and convicted of manslaughter, Walter spends several years in a mental institution, before being conditionally released.  Unfortunately Walter still has issues, and seeking closure, he sets in motion a deadly scheme.Seven friends gather at a home in the country, to celebrate their upcoming graduation from college.  Shortly after the group settles in for the night, Nicole (Steffi Wickens) is abducted while grabbing a snack.  Soon after, Nicole's dead body is hurled through a window, awakening everyone in the house.  Cut into the dead girl's belly, are the letters ""TV"".  The group, switches on the television, and view a video narrated by the killer.  It shows Nicole being urged to shoot her sleeping boyfriend, and then later having refused, they witness the killer slitting her throat.  Walter says that if more than one person is alive in the house at 6am, they will be killed.  If only one person is alive, then no harm will come to them.  For those in the house, the options are either all will die, or only one will survive the night.There is some panicking and a lot of loud discussion, however not a lot of rational behavior comes from it.  Cell phones don't work, and there is apparently no internet, so the group is on their own.  Anyone who leaves the house is apparently fair game, as the killer has traps planted at various locations, and also has a rifle.  The group attempts to escape in the only available vehicle, but the Killer disables it using another trap.  Paranoia grows stronger, as people start to die, and the Killer steps in to provide some additional motivation.  The survivors start to crack under pressure, and turn on each other in an overdramatic last act, that is terribly written and acted.  In the end, Walter does gain some closure, and the reason why the group was chosen for his experiment, is revealed.The film creates a situation, cranks up the pressure, tosses in a few weapons, and then some selfish unlikeable characters, destroy each other.  It doesn't plays out in a very credible way.  The Killer can't be everywhere, so if they had just split up and gone in different directions, the situation would have fallen apart, or at least more would probably have survived.  For whatever reason, the victims apparently believe that the Killer will actually keep his word, and spare the sole survivor.  Through this turns out to be the case, there is really no reason for that trust.The cast do a decent job with what they are given, but the screenplay doesn't do them any favors, having them behave like morons, who stab each other in the back for silly reasons.  Almost everything feels fake and stilted towards achieving the desired goal.  Starring Agnes Bruckner, Patrick Flueger, Ryanne Duzich, Teddy Dunn, Steffi Wickens, Daniel Franzese, and Theo Rossi, the film is worth a watch for the very curious, or those that prefer a slasher type flick with a downbeat ending.",N/A

1308794,"Virtually the exact same problems as the recent Aussie reboot, ""Tomorrow When The War Began"".I'm convinced now that no modern western filmmaker can ""do insurgent"" any more. There's just too much disconnect between the writers and directors of today because they've never known what it's like to be subjugated, threatened and terrified. We're never going to see the kinds of films like we did after WW2, when so many creators literally lived through the various horrors of war, including being conquered by an invading enemy.Read a story once told by a comic book artist. When he was a young man and first tried his hand at illustration, all he had were comic books to teach him. It took many months of hard work, but he finally completed his first project. Impressed and praising himself for the effort and energy he had put into it, he took the art to the publishers thinking he would be hired on the spot. He wasn't.In fact, he was quickly and repeatedly dismissed. Confused, frustrated, and hurt, he finally asked one of the editors 'why' no one was interested. The editor, seeing that the young artist was suffering, took time out of his busy schedule, sat him down and explained that his work was junk. Why? Because he hadn't studied and learned from real life. A comic book is already a highly interpretive form of art, and when you copy and learn from a skewed version of reality, in turn, your version is utterly bleeped. He told him to take proper art classes, learning to draw from life and studying under qualified teachers, so that only when he was truly ready, he should try again.Readily applicable advice to filmmakers.Writers/directors need to experience the event, live the life, do the deed before putting their concepts into scripts. At the very least, do an intense exploration of the topic they're going to film. Otherwise, it's not a depiction of reality but a distorted caricature. For example: In the scene when the young would-be insurgents throw away food. Talk to survivors of invasions and they'll either laugh in your face or knock you upside your head for suggesting throwing away anything, much less food. During the Siege Of Leningrad - the populace ended up eating their cats and dogs - before turning to cannibalism. A disturbing reference made in the original 'Red Dawn' by Powers Boothe's character.Disconnected = Falsity.This reboot is reflective of so many films today: Superficial, underdeveloped and plastic. In this case, one doesn't really believe they're a bunch of kids who have suffered under the brutal thumb of oppression, much less worked their way to becoming unconventional combatants.I hesitated on this next part because I'm essentially committing plagiarism. To be fair, I'm plagiarizing myself. But I don't see the point of duplicating work already completed. So, from my review of ""Tomorrow When The War Began"" --- Why does everyone's makeup look so even throughout the movie? One of the reasons the original 'Red Dawn' worked was you could see how plain everyone was being virtually makeup free. And, most importantly, looked progressively worse as the film went on - which of course makes complete sense. I'm thinking specifically of Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey who were almost unrecognizable by the movie's final&eacute;. That all the females had their hair and makeup intact throughout the flick doomed this to Hollywood ridiculousness.And I won't go too far beyond noting that, apparently, Chris Hemsworth is the only male Wolverine who has been through puberty and growing facial hair.The film's few positives are found when Jeffrey Dean Morgan and crew show up. But the amusing conflict of veteran combat marines being made to look silly by a bunch teenagers doesn't provide enough energy to recover from its creative death spiral.Which of the two reboots hit an uglier target? I'll go with 'Tomorrow' as a larger fail. Reboot Red Dawn works better because of Hemsworth and Morgan; and because first-time director Dan Bradley's background as a stuntman made the final action sequences engaging.Still, if you screen either production, prep yourself for dissatisfaction and disappointment.Personal Notes:- The one aspect I was looking forward to was the airborne assault. And again we see filmmakers with absolutely no experience improperly showcasing a tactic that could so easily been addressed with the assistance of a military advisor. Paratroopers without rucks, heavy equipment being dropped simultaneously with personnel, and an entire bleeping division jumping directly into a city as their drop zone. Which moron came up with that idea? If it's the listed veteran - Dotan Baer - then something got seriously lost in the translation or he flat out failed his job.- I won't rip the producers for turning the enemy into North Koreans.

Tunisian born director Abdelatif Kechiche has shown some sensibility in previous movies (for instance Games of Love and Chance) but this Cannes festival winner feels quite exploitative (his previous movie, Black Venus, was also nasty, disappointing and sensationalistic). The young actresses who play the lead (Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos), who are not porn actresses, appear in very explicit, seemingly non simulated sex scenes (including masturbation, oral sex, fingering and doing the sex position popularly known as the 69). It would be interesting to wonder if a lesbian director (instead of a male director) would have filmed this story differently, perhaps less explicitly and more subtly.

1088533,"I rented this DVD with the quite reasonable expectation that it was a horror genre flick involving insects, along the lines of 'Mimic' or 'Seven'.  After all, it said as much on the box, and was directed by William Friedkin, who brought us 'The Exorcist'.  Be advised that if that kind of movie is what you want to watch, you need to rent or buy something else. Based on a stage play of the same name, 'Bug' takes place almost exclusively in a small and grotty motel room and the even smaller, grottier spaces of the protaganists' minds.  I guess we could call it 'psychological terror', though that seems rather generous.  There are NO bugs in this film except the imaginary ones that exist in a tortured and schizophrenic mind.  Once that is understood, you will be in a position to better evaluate this movie on its merits, such as they are.  Ashley Judd is a luminously talented actress whose role choices tend to skew toward damaged, trashy characters, and I think these same 'victim' roles only serve to keep her talent underrated.  However, Judd mines some really dark places and is willing to go to hell, quite literally, for this material, and her committed, brave performance is one of the few things to recommend this movie.  Harry Connick appears in a brief supporting role as Judd's ex-con ex-husband and steals all of the few scenes he's in.  Judd's character, Aggie, is grieving the abduction loss of her young son, and though this thread is never satisfactorily explored, it does provide an explanation for the emotional vulnerability that leads to her descent into mutual paranoia.  It might have been a cheaper resolution to actually provide the audience with some real bugs, but at least that would have fulfilled our expectations.",N/A

103773,"&quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; possesses many of the good qualities that the great 40's film noirs displayed, but the filmmakers' desire to resort to fashionable 90's movie trends unfortunately riddle their piece with  fatal flaws. First the good--1.) The visual style of the film: In an age  where many movies look like nothing so much as feature length trailers,  (&quot;Usual Suspects,&quot; &quot;The Negotiator,&quot; MOST others)  &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; was refreshingly filmed with truer visual  integrity. Also aiding is Dante Spinetti's exquisite color cinematography.  2.) The approach to character portrayal: This is one of the few films you  will see nowadays in which the performances are fully worked out, and not  sold on cute little epigrams, and other such stupid cop-out devices. 3.)  Guy Pearce: Among the performances in &quot;L.A. Confidential,&quot; his  impressed me the most, successfully avoiding most of the cliched  personalities of this criminally weak movie age. His effort goes further in  establishing him as a multi-dimensional character than the script does. 4.)  The prescence of intelligence in the script: Such a hard commodity to come  by anymore, scriptwriters Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland seemed to be  interested in doing more than just selling the story with star names, big  budget, and promotion. Now for the unfortunate bad--1.) The body count:  This offends on several points. A, not only does the ludicrously enormous  body count of about two dozen not fit the time period of the story, but no  realistic reaction of horror and outcry from government or public towards  the mass butchery ever comes up, making it seem not out of the ordinary for  the 1950's, seriously undermining its persuasiveness; B, the widespread  killing does not fit the spirit of film noir, which always had discreet and  realistic body counts (&quot;Maltese Falcon,&quot; 3; &quot;Big  Sleep,&quot; 5; &quot;Chinatown,&quot; 4; etc.); and usually the deaths  occured offscreen in order to enhance the plot surprises. C, the realism of  showing the cop or detective as more a victim of violence than a cause of  it is jettisoned. And this is because of D, the film's tragic decision to  resort to fashionable 90's gratuitous bloodshed and sadism as its  motivation for excitement, completely going against the classic film noir's  practice of hinging it on character intereaction and plot developments. 2.)  Attempts to portray the characters as multi-dimensional are emetic,  especially in trying to arouse sympathy for Bud White and his ultra-violent  behavior with a sob story of his unhappy childhood which is way out of step  with the rest of the film. The classic film noirs never hazarded to sell  such melodramatic excrescences. 3.) The refusal to break from tiresome 90's  cliches such as: A, the typical big shoot-out finale. Not only does this  again stray from the spirit of film noir, but the mindset of having to  provide blood-spurting fireworks in an attempt to make sure that the  audience leaves the theater satisfied is a pure cop out on the part of  filmmakers everywhere (I mean, who couldn't have guessed it was coming?).  Even &quot;Chinatown,&quot; which appeared in an era in which climactic  gory showdown were fast becoming popular, did not marr its integrity with  such an obvious device. B, the stereotypical 90's portrayal of the  &quot;hero's&quot; (Ed Exley) method of taking charge. Let's see, poor  repressed fellow tries to adhere to proper procedure while investigating,  can't get anywhere, so--casting off his repressive principles--he becomes  nastier than criminals, who then tell him what he wants to know, leading to  solved crime. What ever happened to the uncompromising Marlowe or Spade,  who ferreted out the information with cunning and shrewdness?  4.) Dialogue  is rife with four-letter words, most gratuitously inserted to establish its  &quot;adult&quot; status. 5.) The script is too long, the 2 hr. and 15 min.  running time seeming to have become the standard for films in this flabby  cinematic age. 6.) The outright celebration of corruption and violence:  Since not even the extortionist &quot;hero&quot; is sympathetic; and since  most of the killings are shown in such a graphic and jazzed-up way, this  film is an incitement and unadulterated endorsement of domestic terrorism.  7.) And most fatal, the fact that the entire outcome of the plot hinges on  an alarmingly weak thread, featuring a redundant character: As it finally  turns out, the only way that Ed Exley and Bud White can end their bitter  rivalry and unite to solve the crime is completely dependant on a scene  where Exley visits the hooker, Lynn Bracken--whose only purpose in this  film is to serve as the object for whom the two lock horns over--who then  proceeds to step WAY out of character, and suddenly rips her clothes off of  and they have sex together. This critically lame thread seems concocted out  of pure desperation by the filmmakers; for if Exley doesn't do this, the  entire film crashes in flames. They don't create the meaty roles for women  in the film noir thriller these days like they once did for Mary Astor, Ava  Gardner, Gene Tierney, Lauren Bacall, Faye Dunaway, and others. 8.)  Finally, while not a flaw, the acting has been generally overrated. Kim  Basinger's portrayal of a character that proves to be totally unnecessary  to the film--outside of her physical body, that is--is not exactly awful,  but is far from good. Let's face it, she walked away with an Academy  &quot;compensation&quot; prize for &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;; which,  alas, could not displace &quot;Titanic&quot; in the minds of the  popularity-conscious voters for most every major category. Kevin Spacey's  performance was intelligent, but nothing really beyond what any decently  good actor that was interested could do. Any nit-wit could have been cast  in the unpersuasive role that Russell Crowe filled. So, in conclusion,  there was a great film in there somewhere, but, sadly, the makers of  &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; failed to rise to the task of creating a  superior example of film noir--the sort that we have not seen since  &quot;Chinatown&quot;.",N/A

668036,"No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best Italian horror directors. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your gore cravings. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Lucio from my play list, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a competent director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography. Come on down, ""Aenigma""!And yes, I've used this introduction for nearly every Fulci review I've done.""Aenigma"" arrived near the end of Fulci's storied film career. Anyone who knows anything about Uncle Lucio knows what this means. Yep, that's right. He's clearly running out of steam. What we have with ""Aenigma"" is a ""Carrie"" knock off with little in the way of gory carnage or real scares. Unlike ""City of the Living Dead,"" ""The Beyond,"" or ""Zombie,"" this movie simply won't do much for the diehard gore fan. Here's the story. Kathy (Milijana Zirojevic) ranks near the bottom of the social scale at St. Mary's College in Boston. A constant litany of cruel jokes, smarmy wisecracks, and sneers from her classmates virtually assures us that she'll seek bloody revenge against her tormentors. Sure enough, that's exactly what happens after a particularly vicious prank leads to an accident that leaves Kathy in a coma at the hospital. How can Kathy seek vengeance when she's supine in a hospital bed with lots of wires running from her head to cheesy, beeping machines? That's a good question. An excellent question, in fact, even though it isn't one I'm especially interested in answering. Why should I? Fulci sure as heck didn't care about explaining this clunker to the audience.Anyway, it turns out that Kathy has somehow gained the ability to take over the mind of another girl, Eva Gordon (Lara Naszinsky), and send her into St. Mary's as a sort of Charles Bronson with [...]. Eva befriends all of the girls involved in Kathy's accident, as well as the beefy gym instructor Fred Vernon (Riccardo Acerbi), a man whose own guilt in the accident Fulci clearly establishes earlier. Eva acts sort of tarty, claiming that her goal at St. Mary's involves sucking face with as many boys as possible. She's also a troublemaker in other areas, drawing the wrath of the administration. What happens next? Blah, blah, blah. The girls start noticing weird things about Eva, little facts that don't match up with things she said earlier. Blah, blah, blah. Fred Vernon perishes in an extremely humorous manner. Blah, blah, blah. Who's that weird maid? I'll bet she's important to the plot! Blah, blah, blah. Look! Death by slugs! Blah, blah, blah. Look! Jared Martin paying the rent as Dr. Robert Anderson! Blah, blah, blah. Tom Cruise? What in the heck? Blah, blah, blah. If you haven't picked up on the sarcasm, I found ""Aenigma"" to be...well...pretty darn blah.It isn't difficult to see where Fulci went wrong with this movie. Pretty much everything fails on nearly every level. A lack of serious gore effects we've come to know and love from Uncle Lucio effectively kills the film. Sure, the slug scene works well, and a couple of lame decapitations certainly spices things up here and there, but it's all rather restrained and surprisingly banal. A dream sequence promises carnage but doesn't really deliver the goods. It's sad, really, that Fulci would go to all this trouble to make a horror movie and then fail to ratchet up the grue. You're known for buckets of blood, man, so c'mon and DELIVER! Other elements of the film fail as well, especially the eardrum bursting, bad 1980s pseudo pop songs popping up all over the place. Watching the movie is like being stuck in an elevator for ninety minutes. And what's up with the Slavic actors and actresses in this thing? I'm looking at the names of people involved in this mess and I'm not sure whether I'm reading a cast list or reading roll call for a class at Kosovo Community College. All right, enough with the wisecracking. In short, ""Aenigma"" is a waste of time and space.Image Entertainment released ""Aenigma"" on DVD over here in the states, and I have to say it's a very sad affair. Not as sad as the movie, mind you, but sad nonetheless considering ""Aenigma"" is a Fulci flick. The picture and audio quality aren't that good at all, I thought. Then there's the lack of extras on the disc. I'm the first person to say that I would NOT want to listen to a commentary track or sit through some long featurette explaining every aspect of this film's production, but Fulci fans do deserve something more than a bare bones presentation. Fulci completists will certainly want to pick up a copy of the disc. For casual viewers and uncommitted Lucio lovers, I would recommend going the rental route. ""Aenigma"" really isn't worth spending more than a couple of bucks at the local brick and mortar video store.",N/A

819344,"I found this film mildly gripping until the last act, and then I was sickened. Perhaps I was more sympathetic to Tim Robbins' character's sincere efforts to control his urges than I was to Sean Penn's manic rages, but one need not be conflicted to sense that something is morally and ethically amiss. There is never really any doubt (at least for the audience) of Dave Boyle's innocence of the murder of Jimmy Marcus's daughter, yet Marcus' thuggish character over-rides any such concerns. Marcus coerces a ""confession"" from Boyle after telling him he will let him live, and then once Marcus' pre-conceived notion is thus confirmed, he kills Boyle anyways. Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) shows up just in time to tell Marcus that he has killed an innocent man, and Marcus' reaction can be summed as a ""so what.""  The end of the film doesn't ask any gray moral or ethical questions--quite the contrary. Devine and Marcus wave and smile at each other, as if justice was served--the daughter was an innocent, Boyle was innocent, and they're both dead. It all ""evens out"" in some warped way. The pathetic Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) the only person who apparently cared if Boyle lived or died, is left unnoticed and marginalized. The last ten minutes of the film, thus, makes what transpired before filmmaking mendacity.What exactly was the message Clint Eastwood was trying to convey here? The only one that makes sense to me is  Dirty Harry-type vigilantism where colateral damage is a fact of life is acceptible under certain situations. I, frankly, find such reasoning appalling.",N/A
679341,"Lets pretend for a second that it's perfectly normal to write two reviews based on one movie:Heres the firstJeepers Creepers is one of the most painstakngly tension filled and nerve fraying experiences ive had watching a movie in a long time.And now the second:Jeepers Creepers is a steaming pile of crap whose biggest asparation is to be ranked among other tepid monster/slasher(is that redundant) flicks that should be lucky to get more than one pass but who somehow will inevitably land a sequal.Why two reviews? Because it is two movies ad just for that reason is one of the most frustrating experiences Ive had watching anything.The basic plot is this:A brother and sister on a cross country trip happen upon a site covered(literally) with bodies and find themselves stalked by what seems to be the man responsible.he turns out to be something completly different. This unfortunatly, is the exact place the movie turns into something completly different too. In the first half, the movie builds slowly, the siblings relatonship is portrayed realistically as they are shown bickering about just about everything but through it all show genuine care for each other. The tension starts to build when thy come upon the lair of the creature. Of course at this point they have no way of knowing this terrifying spectacle is not man-made. Inside they find bodies lining the walls, looking eerily laminated. Then they are discovered and a car chase begins as they are being followed by a faceless man driving a black pickup truckin in a sequence that plays out alot like the classic movie Duel. All this works terrifically with mounting tension and shock after shock. I genuinly felt and was afraid for the characters. At this point I was so excited to see how this thing worked itself out I couldnt stand it. i also couldnt stand what the movie descended into after that.Any horror movie that plays on the type of fears the first half of this movie does should know that not only is less more, but that oftentimes the unknown is more terrifying than anything a movie can produce. Especially if after all that buildup, the reveal turns out to be Bat-boy. After that great beginning, the movie disintegrates into schlock jump scare horror with no sense of fun and having answered the question of what the stranger is, the only thing that gave me a case of the willies was realizing it wasnt going to get any better. I did appreciate the ending, at least they had the cajones to end the movie in a way i wasn't expecting, if thy had just had the cajones to give a second half that could live up to the first.",Jeepers Creepers

And the thing that I cannot believe is that this movie won awards.  Yeah, the acting is pretty darn good.  The accents are awesome.  To know that people actually speak that way is hysterical.  But, the movie really has no point.  There was a lot of pointless dialogue that added nothing to the movie besides getting to hear people say &quot;ya.&quot;  At times I didn't know whether to laugh or be shocked.  Normally if someone is shot in the face it's not very funny, but this movie seems to make it.  The humor is what kept me watching, but still, this is not a great movie by any lengths.  Overall, Fargo is an over hyped movie that fails to deliver anything besides a few laughs at some accents.  Not very exciting.  2 Stars",N/A

Oh, well, there's several versions of MADAME BOVARY.  That fascinating train wreck of a love in WUTHERING HEIGHTS.  Something with a stuffy veneer but a destructive burning passion underneath.Then there's JUDE.The elements were there and it's terrifically shot and acted but...yikes.  The story just doesn't carry its audience into sympathizing for these lovers.  The ""society"" isn't personified enough to provide a good villain.  A guy who wants to marry his cousin wouldn't fly too well RIGHT NOW, let alone way back in the day.  After so much destructive calamity is inflicted on this couple--and you definitely get the feeling that much more than merely other people and society is against them--even you're ready to throw in the towel on this affair.If you're the kind of person who wants to only see Kate Winslet naked...you're really going to dislike this movie.  This isn't a Skinna-Max late night romp (NAKED EYES 5 or something), it's not even THE STORY OF O or HENRY AND JUNE, it's a serious adaption of a really old book.  From reading the other reviews, it sounds like they inserted a sex scene that didn't even appear in the novel (I've only read one Hardy novel so far).Before catastrophe strikes (and a WAY over the top disaster), Jude says that he's ""waiting for the world to change"" to accept living and having children with his cousin as a common-law wife.

786525,"Millennia ago, primitive man found fear from the unknown.  That same fear exists today in each of us.  Call it what you will, but ultimately it boils down to horror.  A dictionary definition refers to it as, ""...as sense of dread or forboding"".  A film character, in a haunted house, looks at the doorknob to her room as it slowly turns (only she's supposed to be alone).  The emotion that she feels could well be defined as horror.  When you are alone and you have the distinct feeling that there is someone else there - that's horror.There is a distinct difference between horror and gore.  Cabin Fever is a gore film.  It is not a horror film.  That said, let's take a look at it on its own merits...Cabin Fever is neither particularly scary, nor is it original in the least bit.  It borrows so much of its storyline from a multitude of other films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, The Evil Dead, to name a few).The actors are all unknowns with the exception of the lead boy (Rider Strong) who was formerly on Boy Meets World, a television show.The premise is this: college kids rent a cabin in the deep woods for a week, but somehow manage to catch a severe case of the dreaded (sarcasm) flesh eating bacteria.There's some doper who stumbles across them as they tell ""campfire"" ghost stories to each other outside the cabin - which makes no sense, because the cabin has a fireplace - for no reason than to later end up as a footnote in the carnage.  (And why is his dog in such a bad mood?).There's the three rednecks sharing a single brain with murder on their mind for no darned reason at all (this whole storyline even includes a semi-retarded kid ala ""Deliverance"").To be certain there is lots and lots of gore.  The filmmakers must have gone through gallons of Kayro syrup and red food coloring, because the blood looks anything but like the real thing.  That's not to say that this film isn't gross - because that is one thing it really is.Gross.If you are actually past your teen years you'll probably look away from the screen as I did.  Not in fear or horror - but because gross is just not scary - it's shock value only.I thought I was going to see a horror film - not a gore film.  I can't say that I recommend this film unless you want to see one pair of quite obviously surgically enhanced breasts and a young man (Rider Strong), who desperately either needs to shave both his face and that nasty patch of hair on his chest (and trim that pit hair while you're at it) or hit the gym - because, yuuuck - it's a horror all on it's own.",Cabin Fever

1395191,"I have to say that when I first heard about the concept of Cowboys and Aliens I laughed out loud.  It sounded like fun - like Blazing Saddles meets Space Balls - and I'd have loved to see a serious satire about aliens invading the old West.  Then I read they meant to keep it serious, like maybe True Grit meets Predator.  That sounded good, too.  After all, if there really were aliens  who had the capacity to come to Earth it makes sense that they wouldn't just visit L.A. in the present.  Why wouldn't they show up in medieval Europe, or even the wild West?  I'd love to see what the man with no name does with a xenomorph.  I really liked what Favreau did with Iron Man, and liked the Star Trek reboot by the writers of this show, so I ended up deciding to check this out when it played in our local theater.It turns out, though, the film didn't live up either to its initial hilarity or the subsequent promise of a serious Western in which the townsfolk are abducted by aliens.  They should have gone for funny, because my wife and I laughed out loud as the film hit clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;.  I believe it's supposed to be loosely adapted from a graphic novel, but it felt like the writers decided to watch a bunch of Westerns and sci-fi flicks and then tried to come up with a plot that would give them a chance to hit them all.  The nameless drifter with a criminal past, the apparent prostitute with a heart of gold, the manipulative cattle boss and his psychopathic son, the native Americans with their wisdom rituals, the toothless bandits, the familial reconciliation, the ride off into the sunset...and then why is it that after Alien every sentient being from outer space has an outer shell that opens up to reveal internal mouths and other body parts?They hired decent actors and then gave them lines that were laughable.  They tried to sell Harrison Ford as a greedy and vicious man, who had the whole town under his thumb - in a role reversal of the type that worked brilliantly when Sergio Leone cast Henry Ford as the cruel force of evil in Once Upon a Time in the West.  It didn't work here - both because I didn't find Ford convincing as a bad guy and because the writers chickened out and let him turn out to have a soft side.  They ended up explaining why Olivia Wilde seemed so implausibly awestruck by the sight of Daniel Craig - but even when it was clear who she was her story didn't make sense.  Without revealing anything specific I'll just say it's utterly implausible that, being who she said she was, she'd be there just waiting for the coincidence that Daniel Craig's character happened to have the knowledge and the power that she'd travelled so far to find.  That's just one among many loose ends in the story.  I have a lot of patience, but I found the first half of the film to be overly boring and long.  Eventually it had a few thrilling moments - they didn't entirely waste their special effects budget - and that's why I'm giving it two stars, since if you were distracted and bored at home there might be worse things to do than waste time watching this one.",Cowboys & Aliens
1303718,"I was excited about this, for god knows why.  I mean, I have grown tired of Sandler, and I was never really a fan of Schneider, but Spade and Rock and particularly James have always made me laugh, or at least smile, so the prospect of seeing them all together in a `no holds bar' type family comedy seemed interesting, and promising.  In the end though, this film is just awkward.  Sandler has forgotten how to edit and doesn't know when to stop pushing a good thing when he has it.  When you have scenes to establish friendships that consist of nothing more than five minutes of verbal jokes at friends expenses it becomes tired, redundant and, sadly, unfunny.  This also felt like a lazily constructed comedic version of `Why Did I Get Married' too, and that's saying a lot since Tyler Perry's film was pretty lazily put together itself.  The acting is hit or miss, but acting isn't the point here.  It is the endless gags that suffer from being too overly compacted to the point where the audience never gets a break.  It works in that you don't have time to dwell on the failed gags before one that marginally works catches your eye, but in the end `Grown Ups' feels hugely uninspired and preposterous.  The whole `warm family moments' don't ring true and the loopy development of the actual families is so blatantly obviously manufactured that it takes away from the films marginal appeal.  Thankfully Kevin James is funny and Maria Bello is hot.  Outside of those two positives, `Grown Ups' is a clich&eacute;d mess of a film.

1064174,"This season is, sadly to say, the worst yet.  In a downhill pattern from season to season, Monk has gotten worse and worse.Reasons for believing this:  The character Monk is no longer funny or even that amusing.  Instead, the character gets more and more depressing.  I realize OCD is not ""funny"", but this show was meant to be somewhat comical.Another character who has been getting worse is lieutenant Disher(?).  He's become too moronic to be believable as a cop, let alone a lieutenant.  I realize cops aren't the brightest, but this is pushing the envelope.Thirdly, the fact that Monk (or anybody else on the show) has never found his wife's killer is getting old.  There's no reason to keep this going.  Make a two-episode show out of it.  Do whatever, but just end this.  Monk will still be Monk and maybe this would be a turn in the right direction (i.e. from depressing back to comical, with every now and then, a sad moment in the show).The show Psych seems to be taking Monk's place and the show Monk will soon be weeded out unless something changes in the writing.",Monk: Season Five
1156120,"What if you could go anywhere, at any time, wherever you wanted?  There are people like this - very, very rich people.  They don't have any fear, don't have any comprehension of the worries that plague us all when we travel, or go out alone at night. In Jumper, there's a new category of world traveler: the superhero.Jumpers, you see, are teleporters.  They can teleport anywhere they've seen and they leave jumpscars - dimensional portals - open for a minute or so after they jump.  If you're fast, you can jump in after them.That's all you need to know about Jumper, and that's all Jumper is going to share with you.  There are no details behind teleportation (hint: according to modern scientific theory, if you can teleport you can time travel). Filling the role of villain is a shadowy government agency known as Paladins who have figured out how to anchor Jumpers by lassoing them with electrified nets.  They believe that Jumpers are a threat to mankind and see the ability to jump as religious blasphemy - kind of unnecessary, really, as you can imagine that any government agency would be plenty terrified of Jumpers without all the Biblical angst.But anyway, that's the premise of Jumper: boy meets girl, boy learns to teleport, government agency tries to kill boy, boy meets girl again, repeat until somebody dies.  Only nobody dies.Jumper has to be the most attractively hollow movie I've seen in a while.  Nothing is resolved. Good guy David Rice (Hayden Christensen, broodingly bland as ever) doesn't ever really learn his lesson, Paladin-hunter Griffin (the far more interesting Jamie Bell) is left in limbo, love interest Millie (also bland Rachel Bilson) doesn't deal with the consequences of a romance with a Jumper, and even archvillain Roland (Samuel L. Jackson with crazy white hair) isn't permanently defeated.  The big reveal about Rice's past has no impact on the plot at all since it's revealed in the last five minutes of the film.And that's a shame.  Jumpers are weird folks.  They don't need to worry about money, or responsibility, or fear of death.  They just jump away to some other place.  Do that enough and you start to get a little weird.  A relationship for a Jumper has to be quite strange, especially with someone who can't jump - I imagine Jumpers regularly order food and never pay for it, steal clothes and just walk out of the store, and travel all over the globe at a whim...but there only hints of any of this in Jumper.  The film is made up almost entirely of admittedly breathtaking special effects.There's a reason so many reviewers keep asking for a sequel.  Jumper's barely a prologue. For all of its kinetic energy, Jumper's plot sure doesn't move much.",Jumper

304375,"I feel sorry for Sylvester McCoy. Because of bad management decisions at the BBC, he didn't get a proper regeneration sequence,  his first season was horrible AND short since it wasn't written for him. He was saddled with two companions, one, Mel, who was an unbelievable annoyance and then Ace who eventually had some good moments but also had a mush-mouth and it was often hard to hear what she was actually saying. He only had 12 adventures to play the Doctor on TV at the time and about 8 of them were pretty bad. &quot;Fenric&quot; is one of his better shows but unfortunately that's not saying much. Sometimes, things are not clear in this story, such as the badguy being an old enemy of the Doctor and this really does seem to come out of nowhere. McCoy's Doctor being very secretive and manipulative? Never quite worked for me and I felt the show was at it's worst during his era. He did have some good shows, though, the best being 'Remembrance of the Daleks', 'Happiness Patrol' and 'Battlefield'. Fenric runs in place right after. Keep in mind, I don't blame McCoy but pretty much everybody ELSE involved at the time, right down to the sound man who apparently didn't know what he was doing either when you can't understand  a lot of the incidental dialogue spoken by your two lead actors.

1159660,"Let's first look at the life of the film's producer Adam Sandler for a moment please(it will become clear very soon,I promise).We have a man who is clearly unattractive and unathletic but through pandering to the twits who actually like his films he was able to marry a hot model and live happily ever after(at least until he decides to be a schmuck and upgrade).Why the bio?Because 90% of Hollywood films are made by men like Sandler who cling to a fantasy that if they weren't wealthy and famous they would still have gorgeous women at their feet.Only the catch is that the women didn't start off that way.They were nerdy girls who stayed home on Friday nights memorizing pi and playing D&D;,but they were secret babes just waiting for their geeky dreamboat to come along, take their hair out of their ponytails and their glasses off and turn them into instant sexy Cinderellas.This is why when a film is made about geeky guys becoming cool and popular(a la ""Revenge of the Nerds"")they achieve their goal by staying true to themselves and actually create a new form of cool which is superior to what the sterotypical popular kids have to offer. Contrast this when the same situation is applied to the ladies:the only way they can become cool and popular is by conforming to society's standards,in short they must abandon a large part of themselves.The ""Nerds"" did not become popular by having Arnold show up,get the boys pumped and groomed;they made being a nerd popular.Why can't we have a film like that for women?If you've seen the trailor,you've basically seen the film(along with the only funny jokes):Playboy hangeron Shelly gets kicked out of the mansion on her 27th birthday (""That's 59 in bunny years"").She finds herself in search of a job and a place to live for the first time in her life(this does raise the question about all of Hef's discards who haven't managed to get knocked up by an athlete or B list actor.Is there a bunny retirement fund?),and follows whispers of a party to the local college campus.There she is rejected by the snotty sorority,but finds her place with a group of misfits,most of whom are obviously hot chicks who just dull down their looks with glasses,bad hair,and no makeup:redhead hottie,pierced hottie(Kat Denning is so gorgeous that even when they try to make her unattractive she still blows away 90% of Playmates and models out there),pregnant girl(at least a few months ago she was popular),lumberjack like manly girl,dwarf girl,mute foreign chick,and brace wearing girl(which brings me to my next point:this film wins the Tori Spelling award for nepotism for having not one but two actors who were hired for no other reason but their famous parents:Colin,son of Tom,Hanks and Rumour,daughter of Bruce and Demi,Willis.They are average at best in terms of talent).The girls decide to accept Shelly as their housemum because they need pledges and feel that the only way to get them is to make boys interested in them(huh?I might be clueless,but why?Can't you sell your house as the smart,nonsnotty sorority to girls who,imagine this,came to college to study and not party?Are there no pre-med or advanced science majors looking to join a sorority?).Shelly of course gives the girls ""Glamourshots""makeovers,throws wild parties(how did they pay for the Aztec party,I wonder?That had to be at least a couple grand),and teaches the girls that by acting like braindead tarts their lives will be complete.Along the way Shelly falls for Colin ""not quite Tom""Hanks and learns that there is life beyond the Playboy lifestyle.I know people who liked this film are going to get on me for taking it seriously,but I am sick to death of this genre.The scene where the girls are supposedly reclaiming themselves is very telling: ""Let's keep 60% Shelly"".What this says is that even when she is trying to be herself,she should only allow 40% of herself to come through to the outside world and 60% should be walking Barbie.And how about using girls with actual physical issues,not ones who only require 10 min. of makeup and hair?How about making an overweight girl or one with severe acne feel beautiful and sexy?That would take some guts to say that beauty comes in all forms, and let's face it,Hollywood doesn't have any.To say this film was moronic is to insult morons.I gave it one extra star for the Marilyn Monroe parody and the bunny age line(both of which are the funniest moments in the films and were in the trailor as was mentioned),but really,save yourself the waste of 90 min of your life and don't add any more money to Sandler's bloated wallet.Watch the trailor instead.All of the jokes with none of the garbage.",The House Bunny
555297,"How on earth did Orson Welles ever end up in a dud like this?  I mean... I can hear Welles's magnificent voice coming from what's meant to be King Saul but the makeup he's wearing says bloated, window-peeper.  I'd categorize David and Goliath more on the side of cheesy sword & sandal rather than biblical epic and given the genre It's more than a bit distracting when they try to treat Holy Scripture like Shakespeare; in fact the screenplay sounds like something from an amateur church pageant (thee's and thou's flow like cheap wine).Apparently the director thought a story loosely based on scripture and lavish sets would carry throwing together a group of actors, ranging from legendary to lame, and having them just recite their lines.  Hilton Edwards, the veteran of so many religious and historical films, plays the prophet Samuel but unfortunately looks more like one of those big, slow-moving muppets from the Dark Crystal, randomly quoting unrelated clips of scripture like some sort of a nickel-operated fortune-telling machine.  Listening to the characters David and Eglah (sounding like corny dialogue from bad anime) I almost giggled when she was struck by lightning which just goes to show how detached I was from this terrible film.  Goliath (the main antagonist and half of the title) is obviously a person in a body suit from a distance and a furry, sweaty sort-of caveman close up and his sidekick Cret (meant to be the only comic relief) reminds me more of a goofy claymation character.The real tragedy of this movie is that it obviously had a decent budget but I can't emphasize enough how lame it is overall and the poor transfer quality makes it even more difficult to watch.  It's not my intention to be irreverent with this review, I just think such a beloved story deserves better treatment not to mention that Amazon will usually list this stinker in the recommendations when looking up true religious classics like The Robe, Ben-Hur, Quo-Vadis, etc.  :o)",N/A

115871,"Love Me or Leave Me is the story of Ruth Etting (Doris Day), a real-life jazz singer from the 1920s who made hits with songs like ""Ten Cents a Dance"" and ""You're the Cream in My Coffee."" Her manager Marty Snyder (James Cagney) is an overbearing older man whose love for Etting causes him to bend over backward to help her career. She appreciates him but does not love him, and this unequal feeling between them causes plenty of problems.Although she is obviously a great talent, the casting of Day as Etting is terrible. Etting had a much more subdued voice, so this movie comes out as a showcase for Day's singing talents instead. The song choices are odd too, especially since ""You're the Cream in My Coffee"" is missing. Cagney is very good, but this role is unlike many of his other films, where he is extremely likable in spite of his toughness. Here it is more difficult to care for him. Overall, the main flaw with this movie is the dull storyline. The ascent to stardom is peppered with musical performances, but the movie is thin on plot. The exciting event at the end is too little too late.If you are a fan of either stars, this movie is worth seeing, but unless you adore Day's vocal performances, you will be bored with Love Me or Leave Me.",N/A

But let's be honest, they are not, These are high tech video games with computer generated characters, environments and a manipulative, primitive and ridiculous plot with more than cheesy dialogue.The one aspect that makes these computer generated cartoons watchable is the music by maestro John Williams, whose talent as a composer is so great that he cannot give but the most wonderful and amazing music that elevates (not easily but manages) even these so called films.It clearly shows that by that point George Lucas had unlimited creative sontrol over this franchise and no Lawrence Kasdan to write a magnificient screenplay. What he ended up with is animation for 6 year olds with a phenomenal music. But it certainly has nothing to do with the Star Wars that people have loved since 1977. It's the stupidified, simplified, infantilised version of it. Too bad, because with a really good screen writer and a good director, like say Spielberg, Jackson, Cameron or Fincher, they could've made three awesome films worthy of the name Star Wars.

Their second mistake was in making Rusty positively chatty this time out (different voice, dopey chuckle, it didn't inspire terror it made me laugh).

853898,"There is a scene deep into Yimou Zhang's Hero that burns with inspiration. A warrior bent on assassinating the king of the kingdom of Qin, Broken Sword, enters the chambers of His Majesty and begins a violent assault for which the king is well-equipped. The two men battle with a ferocious intensity, unencumbered by excessive slow-motion or flying effects, while huge tapestries of lime green plunge to the ground like majestic birds shot to their deaths. The scene has suspense, it has intensity, it has life...and unfortunately, that's the only time you'll find those things in the 96-but-feels-like-200 minutes of Hero.Which is kind of shocking, considering the movie starts out with such a promising fanfare. Against a slowly forming background, we learn of the history of China 2000 years ago: how it was divided into kingdoms, how they all fought with each other, and how one king attempted to bring it all to a close. Unfortunately, being a king and all, a lot of people want his ass dead, so the poor dude can't get any sleep. Finally, though, a nameless warrior ends His Majesty's worries by wiping out the three deadliest assassins and the king wants to hear his story. Nameless (Jet Li) proceeds, guided by a rather nice panoramic shot, to the chamber of the king and rests 100 paces from him, with the promise to advance paces at the king's behest. So he begins his story, and the framing device of the film is set up. If Hero had remained in that room with Nameless and the king, it would work. There is a message about honor, about duty, and about patriotism that arises from the film's present-tense frame that I found intriguing in parts. Of course, it would only last about 15 minutes if it did that, but as of now, I'd take that over the pure, shameless tripe that gets slung during the flashbacks.Hero is a perfect case of simply trying too hard. The first flashback of Nameless' murder of the first assassin, Sky, culminates in a dull battle overstuffed with relentless slow-mo, Matrix-esque bullet-time effects, and - but of course - Crouching Tiger flying. I don't have anything against martial arts; I think it's a compelling art that has created some enjoyable cinema. Director Zhang, though, doesn't seem to think that the existence of the violence itself is enough, though, and he insists on hampering it with special-effects flourishes, one after the other. It's tiring, uninspired, and - worse yet - kinda boring.The film moves on to the next stage of Nameless' quest, in which he must get rid of the last two assassins, lovers Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Slowly but surely, Hero reveals itself as what it truly is: an ultra-expensive movie that disguises its vapidity in a frame story with echoes of themes done 100 times before, and 100 times better in other movies. One of the more unnerving aspects of the film is its presentation of metaphors. Instead of subtle gestures that even a semi-stupid audience would get, things like ""music is like sword-fighting,"" and ""calligraphy is like sword-fighting"" are written into the script and said multiple times! Even the visual beauty of the film gets old: cinematographer Christopher Doyle (who so brilliantly photographed Phillip Noyce's Quiet American and Rabbit-Proof Fence) drenches the set pieces in a single color scheme for really no other point than to look pretty.And I'm sorry, call me old-fashioned, but this crap just comes across as silly. I'm not a huge fan of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but I don't really remember unintentionally laughing at some of the flying scenes. Ang Lee's film created that visual as a kind of extension of the characters' abilities: the characters of Tiger seemed so skilled that it just seemed logical that they could defy gravity. Hero just seems like it had extra money and some strings hanging around.There is a decent message (trite as it may be) hidden deep within the film, and when the plot opens wider into a Rashomon-like angle, Hero has brief moments of narrative intelligence. In fact, a scene following many of the flashbacks, in which an important revelation about the king's fate is made, is flat-out well-done. It's all lost, though, in the endless, pointless exercise of style that consumes the bulk of the film. Hero is far from heroic; it borrows from so many other movies, I'd go as far as to call it a wimp. C-",N/A

508911,"The courtroom can often be a place of high drama in cinema (think: A Few Good Men).  In ""The Paradine Case"", however, there just isn't enough compelling material to make its ""verdict"" a success.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Mrs. Paradine (Alida Valli), an English women accused of murdering her husband.  When lawyer Anthony Keane (Gregory Peck) is called onto the case and falls for the widow in an instant, however, his ethical responsibilities to the bench are pulled to the fraying point.The number one problem with this movie is that the plot is terribly predictable.  I won't give away any details here, but there are enough hints and innuendos given throughout the film that the verdict that should have been ""shocking"" at the film's climax is rendered relatively inert.  Perhaps such film-making tactics were commonplace in the 1940s and easier for audiences to digest, but more seasoned film fans will find it annoying that nothing in this movie is ever questioned or rendered remotely suspenseful.The other problem with ""Paradine"" is the whole ""love at first sight"" angle between Peck's character and the lead female role.  This is a flimsy plot contrivance that should have been delved into more deeply instead of just accepted in the blink of an eye.  While watching, I wanted to know more about that main relationship, but instead we are just supposed to buy-in from the get-go and, again, not question a thing.About the only redeeming value in this film for me was that the ethical struggles are indeed endearing and important to the law profession.  Those are the issues that the film should have focused on instead of spending so much time on a romance angle that viewers can see will not be surprising in the least come conclusion time.Thus, this is one of Hitch's poorer efforts in my book.

208445,"I saw this flick on HBO when I was in high school many, many years ago.  Jack Nicholson directs as well as stars in this vehicle. I purchased this film because I vaguely recalled a humorous scene where Nicholson voraciously downs half a chicken and then leeringly implores Mary Steenbergen for some dessert. Unfortunately, I didn't recall the rest of the movie in which  Nicholson overacts a great deal and seems to be presenting himself as Charles Manson with a sense of humor.  My mistake for buying this hamfest.  Don't get me wrong; I love Jack Nicholson; I've been a fan of his for years; but, like many actors, he needs a strong director to rein him in to prevent him from doing what he does in this movie, which is overplaying and hamming it up and mugging for the camera.  The movie is actually boring and even tedious at times.  There are glimpses of the Nicholson sly sense of humor, but overall I should have spent my money on something more gratifying, like a tuna fish sandwich.Needless to say, I was disappointed with this movie.  Oh, well; you can't win 'em all.  And, I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most avid Nicholson fan who wants to own all of Jack's films that are out on DVD.  Aside from historical worth and a chance to see a younger, preening, leering, full of himself, salacious, hooting and hollering Jack, I would keep my money if I were you.  Sorry, Jack.  You're great; but you over did it in this one.For the record, Mary Steenbergen is quite good in her usual underplaying, subtle, and quietly sensuous way.  I love her face and never tire of seeing it on screen.  There's something about her that you can't help but adore.  John Belushi is also good in a small part as one of the employed thugs of the law.  Christopher Lloyd is good too as a lawman in a part that precedes his ""Doc Brown"" days from ""Back To The Future.""  The sets are realistic and the terrain is wild and rustic.  The movie is also put together fairly well.  But, like I stated previously, there is just too much Jack; Jack all over the place.

532871,"Gimme a break. Rolling up characters for an actual D&amp;D game would be a better use of time. The acting deserves an award, the kind given to the most promising high-school thespian in a small town. Lines are repeated and expressions are worn, but it's not enough.Fortunately, this is an action flick. Acting is secondary. There are enough melee scenes for any pubescent lad to get his testosterone blazing. Plenty of choreographed fight scenes &amp; clever effects. Stop action animation is better than we saw in 50's B movies. But, an important point was overlooked--everything in the movie is new. Clothes are clean, just off the costumers' sewing machines.Let's not forget the villain, Profien. Not at all convincing, more of a geek. Banal, not convincingly evil. This, then, is perhaps the most real part of the movie. True evil rarely wears horns &amp; carries a pitchfork. On the other hand, if you see a bald guy with blue lips &amp; an attitude ... Run!I wouldn't let a child less than 8 or 9 watch this movie, and nobody that young without an adult in the room. There are some intense scenes which a younger child could find disturbing. Unfortunately, most people old enough not to be disturbed will be old enough to be bored.Pretty much a two star movie all around.

453650,"This film has features akin to many mediocre science fiction films, in that it establishes an inherently interesting premiss, but fails to portray its protagonist as a credible, fully realised character.  Whatever 'journey' or development this character then undertakes seems obvious and almost inevitable, to the point of being unsatisfying.  The plot becomes similarly devoid of surprises.  Watching this might also be compared with viewing an 'escape' movie (i.e from a prison, or prisoner-of-war camp),  where very quickly you know where everything is headed - the pleasure then becomes that of the details, the mood, and unexpected insights into people's behaviour under stress (see 'Le Trou' for a classic example) - unfortunately, 'The Truman Show' is not strong on any of these counts.*Jim Carrey has a very limited talent.  He seems like a caricature of himself, every facial expression, every bodily gesture, being exaggerated.  This is fine for generating a certain kind of humour (Jerry Lewis did something similar), but it seems less than ideal as a technique for evincing audience empathy.  His casting here is regrettable.  I can imagine people leaping to his defence, but just imagine if this film starred an actor capable of rendering a complex personality, a personality riven with conflicting emotions and desires, rather than the 'one-emotion-at-a-time' style of Carrey - think Jeff Bridges (who appeared in Weir's 'Fearless'), or if you want go for broke, a young Marlon Brando.*What is more (or less), every other character is limited in depth and humanity.  Ed Harris, blank-faced veteran of such unreflective films as 'The Firm' and 'Apollo 13', gives a one, or possibly two, dimensional performance as producer turned god (perhaps this is forgivable as humanity has never been a notable quality of producers or gods).*Weir is at his best being suggestive.  'The Last Wave' is brilliant in this regard.  He's great at certain brooding atmospheres - see also 'Witness', or 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'.  Here, however, he is being didactic (tediously so) and the atmosphere is cheesy grins and half-baked sentimentalism - not his, or anyone else's,  forte.*So, be careful with this film.  It seems to have scored high marks with the critics, and technicians such as 'script doctors', because it is 'more intelligent' than the average Hollywood product - well, yes, but when you're talking 'Hollywood' and 'intelligence' then you're talking about a very low average.*My vote for a truly great contemporary American film goes to David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive'.",N/A

It was a disappointment across the board, with just a couple of bright spots. The interaction between the girl and her father was touching. The acting by the two young stars was in character, but the script was not up to par and the rest of the actors were handicapped by the lines and situations they were required to deliver. It was shocking to see Patrick Swayze looking so old in this film. It didn't do him or the film justice. He would have been better off in a serious role rather than the bit player he was here.The scriptwriter tried to do too many things in this film and as a consequence, accomplished none of them. The acting, the dancing, and the overall production were disappointing, to say the least. None of it was credible.

308635,"I can only review this film because of its subject matter, which is of central interest to a society on the verge of forgetting entirely where it came from (much less knowing where it is going). So because it is so  important a story, however badly the film itself has been handled has to be  partly overlooked.Set in Amazonia, the film bears some remarkable  similarities to ""Black Robe,"" the Canadian historical film of some years  ago. Both films deal with ""first contact"" with the natives, and in so  doing, they present a cinematographically rich portrait of native cultures.  One wonders if they are not overdone in fact; the details of costuming  (sic) and decor are extravagantly attended to. Indeed, that is where the  film falls down for me: too much attention to detail and a complete loss of  rapport with the viewer in the meantime, as the main story gets lost as  much as any explorer ever did in any jungle. In addition, the impact of  this film's occasionally grandiose photography is (as in ""Black Robe"")  somewhat lost on the television screen.There are entire sections that  might be cut right out of this unnecessarily long film. So from the  beginning, we have to deal with a poor script, which has us undergo all  sorts of very unsatisfactory gimmicks and complications. Planes almost, but  not quite, fly into waterfalls; an Indian trips on the local soma and goes  bananas... In the best Hollywood tradition, nothing is allowed to happen in  an ordinary way. The story is loud and stops and starts fitfully, obviously  uncertain of its direction. The European actors are third rate and quite  unbelievable. The natives, at least, who must have felt somewhat more at  home in this exotic location, are an improvement. And there the story lies,  with whatever interest anybody might take from the overall picture: the  natives are being dispossessed as fast as land can be cleared for cattle to  graze on so we in North America can eat plenty of hamburgers. It's an old  story now, but has anything changed? This is taken from the book of the  same name, written by the very fine author, Peter Matthiessen. Pity he  didn't write the scenario as well.",N/A

Through deaths, careers, and education, family and friends begin to wonder whether or not Tom and Violet are ever going to walk down the aisle.  And, you know what, so did I.While the performances are great and the overall story is interesting enough, the biggest problems here are pacing and structure.  The movie is all over the place.  The story feels very episodic as, in one scene while taking care of her niece, Violet is shot in the leg with an arrow.  Obviously, Alex (Chris Pratt; Wanted, ""Parks and Recreation""), Tom's best friend and father to Violet's niece, is pissed that Tom's negligence led to the accidental shooting.  Then suddenly we flash cut to Alex toasting Tom for being a great guy.  This type of editing makes you forget that you're watching a movie and not a soap opera which also helps to contribute to the overlong run time.  Through out the duration of the movie, I kept wanting to either look at the clock or found myself thinking about something else entirely.  Jokes are repeated.  ""Don't worry, they'll live.""  Jump to a funeral.  ""At least no one died"".  Once again, another funeral and still no wedding.  Tom grows a really fake looking, Yosammitti Sam beard anc mustache.

If you want stunning visuals and bombastic  sound, he's your man.  If you want a storyline with some level of  sophistication beyond Saturday morning cartoons, it's best to look  elsewhere.Star Wars fans (and I consider myself one) can whine all  they want, but childishness is an inherent part of Lucas' cinematic ouevre.Whenever Lucas steps away from the controls and lets someone else drive  the plot, the results are as amazing as &quot;The Empire Strikes  Back&quot;, the hands-down favorite of most Star Wars fans.  When George is  actively engaged in the script, we get dreck like the Ewoks and Phantom  Menace's Jar Jar Binks.&quot;Episode I-The Phantom Menace&quot; could  never live up to its prerelease hype in any event, but with Lucas firmly in  command the movie is even more execrable than may otherwise have been the  case.  How bad is it?- The incoherent plot involves some nonsense  about interstellar trade regulations- The Force, previously a kind of  New Age mysticism, now seemingly stems from a parasitic infection- The  main force for good is a 14-year old &quot;elected queen&quot; of a planet  named Naboo, of all things, who spends much of the movie in Kabuki makeup  speaking in desultory monotone- The villain never speaks a word, and  seemingly exists for the sole purpose of having a lightsaber duel with two  of the heroes- A major character actually chooses slavery over freedom,  mainly as a cheap way to write her out of subsequent scenes- Unlike Luke  Skywalker, who had a painful and awkward apprenticeship before emergind as  a full-blown hero in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Anakin Skywalker is  invincible from the word go, despite being only 9 years oldThe movie is  a colossal disappointment, and not just due to the inflated expectations of  fans.  While a number of the visuals are simply stunning, the plot is a  total mess, which substantially undermines the movie's impact.  The final  victory comes so cheaply and ridiculously as to serve as a sort of parody  of the first film (imagine Luke destroying the Death Star in a Landspeeder  while on the way to Tachi Station to look at some power convertors and  you'll see what I mean).Fans hope against hope that the second  installment will counter this trend and restore some sense of menace to the  series.

1259303,"Anyone with any intelligence knows these flicks are usually guilty pleasures that hinge themselves on car culture: bad teens, fast cars, racing, chases, crashes, and hot chicks. These kind of flicks usually contain a few bubblegum elements, but this movie careens wildly off the guard rail with an implausible and overly serious storyline, a lot of terrible acting, not enough real car stunts, and the completely humorless execution of a bad script. There are absolutely no jokes, winks, or smiles in this dented wreck of a film. There is a short ROAD WARRIOR gag at the front of the flick. And, only one good racing scene utilizing real stunt drivers. That's it. The two rips thru the border tunnels are CG.Even though Lucas Black's performance was a serious affront to the profession of acting (Black played the kid in SLINGBLADE), at least TOKYO DRIFT had some great set pieces for the cars. The opening race thru the construction site, the drift race up the parking ramp, the chase thru Tokyo, and the final drift race down the mountain in that muscular Mustang, made it worth watching for all the car enthusiasts out there in TVLand.Wow! Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are so bad in this flick it's almost laughable. The cars in this flick have more personality than these two guys. They're both sleepwalking thru their performances. Diesel squints and displays only two emotions. 1. ""Don't mess with me, I'm concentrating on the road."" 2. ""Don't mess with me, I'm concentrating on revenge."" Which is really just the same emotion. Diesel seems like a nice enough guy, but let's face it, he doesn't possess a great range as an actor. Paul Walker is just... well, Paul Walker. Paint him lime green, slap some rims and vinyls on him, and he's good to go. I was really looking forward to seeing Michelle Rodriguez strut her stuff in this flick because I adore her. But, it seems that these cola commercial filmmakers found a way to remove her early from the festivities before I could finish undressing her with my eyes.

So, something good did come out of this flick.Two Stars (and that's being generous), because the look of the film is decent, there are some cars in it, and the music, though certainly cliche, is good.

The movie starts well, with some unique perspective on characterization and techniques in revealing the alone-ness of characters.

Why did he experience a siginificant state of epiphany later on? Not clear. Portman claims to ba a pathological liar. Does she really stop lying? Not clear? What is there is merely the romance plot, which, inevitably leads to whole movie to end in a commercial way, like many others high-school romance. Garden State is about the troubled generation, about how the troubled individuals survive in their difficult lives. As a view, I can see how they are troubled, but I can't see how they are relieved.

554110,"This was one of the most unpleasant experiences in hearing and watching an opera DVD.  This looked and sounded as another casualty of experimental German productions, although in costumes and staging this was extremely conservative.  I knew for long that Salieri was a master in comical operas, but this was not funny at all - it all looked like rather an austere burlesque at some country fair, with gray dull colors and boring looks.What added gravely to that impression is that there was no one good voice here!  How could it be?  Master Ford, the tenor, was shockingly awful in his opening aria, and never better later.  All female voices were screeching with various degree of abominable;  they also are made to play in a very dull and dumb manner.  If there was anything witty and funny in Shakespeare, nothing remained of it.  Indeed, time better spent would be just to read the play and leave acting and sound to imagination.I am not sure why this opera seemed so poor.  My exposure to Salieri was quite limited, and came mostly from listening to Diana Damrau's mixed recording of Mozart, Salieri and Righini arias.  However, Salieri was very popular in his time, and even preferred to Mozart, so it could not be so bad.  I expected much more musically, and maybe it was not just the best opera by Salieri, while nothing could really remedy the very mediocre troupe of singers.  In addition, I am not sure if it was really a good idea to make Falstaff look simply repulsive - sometimes these German post-modernist take things too literally, and the ugliness of this Falstaff was too true, with nothing funny about it.  Also, these supposed ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" looked more like Witches as well. Grim and morose hues were stiffing. Thus, in addition to being so disappointing vocally, this production was not pleasant visually as well.The only benefit to me was to hear to my amazement how much Rossini there was; it seems that the entire ""Pace E Gioia Sie Con Voi""  from ""Il Barbiere di Siviglia"" Gioachino just borrowed from here, as he is quite famous to do - borrowing from himself and obviously others.  Also one could hear occasional Mozart in this ""Falstaff"" - from ""Le nozze di Figaro"", perhaps, and some hints from ""Don Giovanni"" and ""Cosi fan tutte"".  Surely the reciprocal influence of Salieri-Mozart can be well-appreciated in this otherwise a poor production.Recommended for educational purposes only.",N/A

The husband, Tom (Lewis Fiander) hates crowds. He is the typical snobbish traveler who longs to be free of all other tourists. His wife Evelyn (Prunella Ransome) is several months pregnant, and would be happy basking in the sun and writing postcards to the two children she and Tom left at home. But she goes along with his side adventure to please him.All goes smoothly until Tom and Evelyn come ashore on the island of Almanzora. The village there is quaint, but the only people around at the moment are children. Tom, the stiff upper lip spouse, insists on a rational explanation: perhaps there's a fiesta in progress, on the far shore. Evelyn, the more intelligent of the two but prone to brief emotional outbursts for good reasons (like her condition and her brick-headed husband), suspects Tom of withholding crucial information from her. Above all, there is something noticeably not right about the children who alternately congregate and hide from their foreign visitors.Most of the film takes the form of a slow build, as Tom and Evelyn discover more and more evidence that Tom's rational explanation is far from the truth. A couple of violent incidents tip the scales, but Tom persists in denying what he sees.Unfortunately, the rest of the film (including its climax) is weakened by uneven acting. The stakes are not high enough, because we don't care about Tom and Evelyn, although the film's odd premise still offers a surprising degree of mystery and dramatic weight.

I watched this film twice giving it my full attention.  I truly enjoyed the scenery and the overall artistic style was very nice.  I did watch it on a VHS tape so it was a bit grainy but that may have added to the charm.  The problem I have with this film is that it goes against my understanding/concept of Buddhism and Zen teachings.  The entire film was a depressing ordeal from beginning to end. I understand the intent and lessons of the film but I would rather see a Zen Master who treated his family with kindness and affection.  A boy lost in the woods and no one cares.  A group of people sitting around the fire in silence who do not recognize the existance of another human being. This is not a Master who I would respect or even enjoy being in his company.  A dying Master who smiled on his death bed and showed compassion is what I want to see.  Life and Death is a combination of emotions.  There should be SOME joy in both Living and Dying. Perhaps this Master needed more training... Then again maybe it will be better for him the next time around. If the intent of this movie is to show how unhappy people can be then it is a Winner.

144363,"I had not seen this movie in a while, and I found myself laughing at some of the cheesier parts of it, and there were a lot of cheesy parts.  This was the sequel to the surprise hit Species from a few years before, which was inevitable, yet much creepier, much more far fetched, and rather difficult to swallow.  The embryos stored from the first growth experiment were frozen for another time, and one was brought back to make Eve, a new and improved alien / human hybrid.  In the meantime, an astronaut crew went for the first manned mission to Mars and returned infected with the same alien virus (or whatever it is) that brought us Sil from the first movie.  The GQ model captain has returned to earth, infected and sewing his wild oats with all the hot girls he can get his hands on, producing some silent, equally as creepy little children who keep looming in the distance in silence (think Village of the Damned).  And we bring back the old team of Michael Madsen (who should be back in Quentin Tarentino movies, even though he brings his bad ass criminal self to a good guy law enforcement role), who Sil always had a thing for.Oi ...  The sex and violence scenes are disturbing to say the least, but since they are in a sci fi movie it looses it's nastiness.  Not for prudes either.  If you have to, see it for the sake of seeing a sequel but don't continue from there.  And how DID that cat get in the ambulance at the end?",N/A

The film starts out fairly promisingly but just lumbers along from there on out. I was a fan of director Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Red"" but this film is not as remotely excellent as that film.

484461,"I have several of the graphic paperbacks from the X/1999 clamp production.  I've read and puzzled over those, and now I have spent several hours with this DVD.  There comes a point in the quest for value where one has to finally ponder why a work is the way it is.  I don't expect every DVD or book to be a work of art, but I do expect that each such effort have some sense of its purpose or potential value.In the case of 'X', I confess I am mystified.  On the surface, a young man (Kamui) returns to Tokyo at the behest of his dying mother to defend those he loves.  But he fails to defend Kotori, who loves him, and forces his friend Fuuma to make impossible choices.  On the layer below this Kamui and Fuuma are doomed to become the primary antagonists in a struggle over whether the human race should be allowed to survive.  In the ensuing fight, shared with the other dragons of heaven and earth, the destruction is sufficient to wonder whether the cure is worse than the disease.In truth, the plot is a pre-ordained ballet of opposing forces driven to a tragic conclusion.  I am not familiar with Japanese literature, but 'X' reminds me of a Greek tragedy where anyone could stop the inevitable end, but no one does.  Kamui's tragic flaw is his inability to act until it is too late.  Fuuma, supposedly the villain of the piece, seems to be the nobler of the two, simply because he throws himself into his role.  All of the characters are disjointed archetypes, but despite all of the symbols and portents, nothing really gels.So this becomes an apocalypse in search of a cause.  Harumitsu Shimuzu as put together an excellent score, which seems to capture Kamui's perpetual agonizing and the film's ambivalent perfectly.  The film's theme, 'Forever Love' by Yoshiki, is worth keeping as well.  But good music and interesting artwork are not enough to overcome a skeletal plot that never moves in any direction for long.  A glance at the final credits reveals that this was a production with a cast of hundreds, and perhaps that is the problem.  Tragedy is best when it is not designed by committee.",X - The Movie VHS

Obivously, even if you've never seen the musical, you know that the movie version is going to be different because, well, you don't get the luxury of ""takes"" on stage, and a movie is much larger than a stage production ever could be.For the movie itself, this DVD was magnificent. ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is one of the best movies I've ever seen, with the stunning visuals and well-rounded cast of actors and actresses. As a DVD, the full-screen edition SUCKS, because, well, there are no extras! All you get is the theatrical trailer. Had I paid attention instead of just assuming that the Full-Screen DVD would have all the same extras as I'd seen advertised for the Special Edition Wide Screen version, I would have never bought this DVD. I was foaming at the mouth with excitement over getting home and watching the behind-the-scenes documentary, and instead all I got was the preview. Bluh.But if you don't care about extras and just want to see the movie, then BUY IT!! By all means, BUY THIS MOVIE. It's a wonderful adaptation of one of the most beautiful stories ever told on stage, and everyone should see it at least once.

This film just doesn't capture the feel of that show and even though the animation isn't bad, it also isn't all that great. I don't mind remakes when handled with care, but this one seems uninspired and almost pointless. Sure I want to see Astro Boy with all the advances made to animation, but lets do it with an inspired story and people who give a hoot. It's actually a boring movie, which should never be the case when you're talking about an animated film....or any film for that matter! Astro Boy bombs away? Yep!.. It sure does!",Astro Boy
1683401,"When I first heard about this film when it was originally titled &#34;The Tomb&#34;, i couldn't wait to see it! A Sly and Arnie team-up action thriller, this is the movie we had been waiting years to see! Despite not being hits at the box office, I really enjoyed The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head so I was very excited to see Escape Plan and hoped it would be up there with the other previously released films.While the film had a good start and some decent moments, it ended up being one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me. First off, the film despite starring two of the biggest action stars of all time, feels much more like a generic prison escape thriller than an action movie. It does have action here and there, but not nearly as much as you'd expect. And without enough action, there just isn't enough there to keep the film entertaining for it's nearly 2 hour runtime. While Arnold who looked like he was having a blast was very fun to watch, Stallone looked tired and seemed like he really didn't want to be there and just showed up for a paycheck. I love Stallone, but he really did take some of the much needed energy out of a film that was in need of it. The story was interesting for the first half of the film, but I felt like it really dragged around the halfway point and really wanted it to wrap things up. The action that is in the film is actually very good and the climax which goes on for a good 20 minutes is awesome!It did have it's moments, but being a huge fan of the two actors, I couldn't help but feel extremely letdown. It just felt dull and rather generic for what it could've been. Worth renting, but it's just disappointing knowing how great this could've been. I'd recommend The Last Stand, Bullet to the Head, or Homefront if you are looking for 80's-esque action films.",N/A

The moral of the story is that just because you have a script and a camera doesn't mean you should put it on film without thinking about it first.

While it seems to strive for the intense, graphic-novel-inspired asthetics of ""Sin City"" and ""300"" (both great-looking films, in my opinion), the visual storytelling in ""Renaissance"" is too dark (literally), too hard to follow, and the constant flipping between what's black and what's white, what's positive and what's negative, made my corneas throb.In short, I was disappointed.

The characters (and their ""issues"") were cardboard cut-outs with predictable over-reactions, arguments, and the like. The plot movement felt more like a shakey waggon with loosely tied luggage falling off at every bump than the solid, streamlined plot development of a well done movie.

104796,"High praise for this film comes from Hammer fans deciding WHICH HAMMER VERSION to pick. I never saw any other Hammer films. I'm rating this as ""cinema"" and it lacks the poetry and strangeness of the 1931 version. This is too much like a graphic novel with cardboard characters catering to viewers well versed in the story and satisfied with ticking off elements. Crude ""variations"" such as hiding Dracula's coffin in the victim's cellar are trivial and achieve nothing. The variation of deciding to cast suave Peter Cushing as van Helsing is even worse --- it deflates dramatic tensions and robs the film of connections with dark worlds. Here van Helsing is portrayed as a Harley Street smoothie, comfortable and relaxed. At crisis time, his soft spoken, polished advice + his relaxed air while presiding over desperate medical procedures are more appropriate to risk-free acne treatments than combating virulent forces of darkness. In the original 1931 film and in Cuppola's recent one, we see van Helsing's true nature as a half-frantic refugee from terrifying research territories, armed with knowledge too powerful to share. Those two van Helsings are buffeted by agitation, panic and crisis, revealing only a sliver of their discoveries and knowledge. Smoothie Peter Cushing conveys none of this, gently inviting us to glide our way to safe harbour.Other deep terrors are masked when we see Big D. preferring women who are no longer young. Much is lost by this. The horror of innocent young girls trapped in horrible futures vanishes. And surely Dracula himself would prefer & be able to find younger and more attractive women to spend eternity with than the ones he's selected here --- the last one being a middle aged wife long in the tooth, set in her ways and well over the hill. I can't imagine anyone watching it twice.

They even totally edited out the end 'walk on the beach scene' and replaced it with a static comic strip!  That alone ruined this 'cut.'  That scene said alot.  It represented the end, the end as in the Warriors are presumably going home and the end of the movie.  It is also the memorable scene I recall of cabel all those years ago.  These cuts were almost as bad as the Star Wars DVD's!What they should do is to in clude the original intro which truly sets up the story.  Forget that it took place in the daylight!  They should alos include all deleted scens to give in some length and GET RID OF THE COMIC BOOK BS!The sound is horrible!  That is, the Dolby Digital.  The center channel(dialog) disappears and the channels get crossed.  You end up not being able to watch it in surround sound!  I hope it is not my amp, but I have not had a problem up to this point.  This sound is hard to deal with.  If the channels were correct, it would be fine.  I await the ""director's orignal cut!""",The Warriors VHS

This movie basically just kept saying &#34;Maybe Santa is real and maybe he's not.&#34; My son Knows hes not real (he's got a mind like a scientist, you have to physically show him things or he just doesn't believe.

514747,"John Leguizamo is a talented and diverse actor. Mira Sorvino also has a number of roles on her resume that distinguish her as gifted in the diversity department. These roles in Summer of Sam are not particularly flattering of their skills, nor is the script particularly well written. The script jumps around quite a bit, trying to illustrate the lives of several characters during this period of ""terror"" in New York, when a crazed, maniacal killer was running through the city murdering dark haired women. There is too much of the debauchery of the day emphasised-the drugging, the clubbing, the sex party orgies, and Leguizamo's character's complete inability to be faithful to his wife, played by Sorvino. Leguizamo is having an affair with his boss (Bebe Neuwirth) and just about all his clients (he is a hairdresser). And basically any other woman he meets. And yet he cannot seem to perform with his wife. The fact that we know all these things about him really does not lend credibility to the film . We know far more about his sexual proclivities than we know about anything else in this film. In fact it is never quite clear what we are supposed to be getting from this film. It tries, but it never gets where it wants to go.",N/A
693009,"First off, if you really want this film, you can buy it more cheaply as part of theExtreme Zombies 8 Movie Collection.A teenage boy moves to Grosse Pointe, Michigan. He begins dating a teenage girl. Her biker ex-boyfriend is disenchanted by this turn of events. He and his pals try to beat up the teenage boy. But before they do, some zombies turn this teenager into another zombie -- who then stalks and begins killing the ex-boyfriend's gang. (Well, it's not really a gang -- they're kinda preppy for bikers.)Yes, this film is sorta crappy. It's a low-budget indie effort shot in Michigan. The actors are no-name locals, without any discernible acting abilities. The dialogue is often drab, even for a zombie film. Some of the special effects (e.g., when the cops run over a woman) are inept, but in a hilariously gory, low-budget kind of way.Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed this film. (Admittedly, you have to like home movie quality, grassroots indie horror films.) It's mostly well-paced. Only a few instances of overly long scenes of empty chit-chat. And it's mercifully short at only an hour and 7 minutes (not including end credits -- which run surprisingly long for such a low budget effort.)The ""original score"" by Jeffrey Michael effectively enhances the film's mood. Michael also has a role as one of the bikers. (He's a better composer than actor.)Some scenes are washed-out and flatly lit, but some scenes (the final confrontation between the cops and zombie bikers) have that certain haunting quality which occasionally pops up in low-budget indie efforts. That serendipitous moment when inept, trashy gore collides with an eerily-lit and well-composed shot.One critic said that BIKER ZOMBIES was shot on VHS. I'm not so sure. There's a moment of ""comic relief"" in this film, set in a diner prior to a zombie attack, in which a pretentious film student lectures on the superiority of film over video. So I wonder if BIKER ZOMBIES wasn't shot on 16mm (or even super-8mm) film stock?",Biker Zombies
183078,"I bought this because I love Dvorak, and know little or nothing about his operas...I confess I began to watch it without reading the plot synopsis...tried to figure out what was going on without it...I think it's a reasonable expectation that one should be able to understand the plot that way.  So...what's with this girl in the swing, and the pond in the middle of the bedroom floor?  OK...it's a modern interpretation...oh, she's a water nymph, and she's sitting in a tree. It's not that her bedroom has flooded; it's a woodland pond.  Sigh. I hate these modern versions--a fairy tale should be a fairy tale, and in the case of an opera like this, which is not as well known as most, most viewers will (like me) never have seen it before, so why not go with a real tree, a pond, etc.?  This modern nonsense spoils it. Can we expect to see Hansel and Gretel set in the South Bronx? Also, I agree with others...just because it's sung in English (why on earth?) doesn't mean it doesn't need subtitles.  I can only catch about half of the words.

675926,"I can see how this film would be popular with a certain audience.  Hedwig is one of those cutsey/artsy films that is clearly in origin intelligent enough to be really great but seems so caught up in its gimick rather than getting down to telling a story that in the end I couldn't consider this film anything more than a failure.True, there are plenty of films that don't have half the talent that Hedwig does, but its just that promise with a failure to deliver that's so frustrating.  So, let's itemize this nonesense:1.  If you don't love the music, forget it.  The obvious nods to Bowie are certainly enjoyable, but the music literally pads out over half the movie.  In a true musical, we actually have the narrative of the story explained and strengthened through the songs.  At times it feels like Hedwig was doing this but most of the time it seems like they were having more fun doing fake music performances.  Why not just watch Spinal Tap instead?  Because the songs take up the majority of the film and bring the tiny amount of narrrative flow in the movie to a near standstill, unless you're absolutely enthralled with the music in Hedwig, the film can't help but dissapoint.2. What I was waiting to develop during all those songs was a great story that just didn't happen.  I was actually interested in main character and many of the unexplained side characters.  The fact that hedwig was a TRUE freak among a profession of poesers was absolutely fascinating.  Did the movie bother to explore any of this?  Absolutely not.3. What we get instead of an actual resolution to the nonexisting story is a rather inept attempt at a freak-out ending, complete with sets that were formerly all black changing to all white, Hedwig rips off his/her close, walking around near naked and looking identical to his love/hate boyfriend Tommy.  There's supposed to be something deep with how men and women used to be one being and were split, but it feels as though it was carried off so incompetantly or simply incompletely that whatever message the director was intending feels utterly lost--meaning that really the last 20 minutes are essentially a waste.I'm left wondering why this film has received such a high rating and so many positive reviews.  Where other films have explored similiar grounds with much greater effectiveness, Hedwig seems only capable of raising them, singing about them, but then gives up.  Or perhaps it was just one big music video?  Hedwig certainly isn't the worst film I've seen by any measure, rather, it isn't a movie.  Just a pretentious artsy pile posing as one.",Hedwig and the Angry Inch

52618,"Yes, Eddie Murphy is amazingly chameleonic in this reworking of Jerry Lewis' classic 1963 comedy.  Unfortunately, Eddie's not totally funny in this crass update.  If you're into flatulence or fat jokes, then this movie is right up your alley.  But its threadbare plot takes second place to Eddie's mugging not only of his title character and alter ego, but also all of the Klumps as well.  Jada Pinkett is the customary African/American woman who does her best (Like Halle Berry or Vanessa Williams) to look as Caucasian as she can.  The late James Coburn as a cameo role as a hotshot millionaire out to fund Murphy's research project, and Dave Chappelle has a bit as a stand up comic who is not all that funny either.  While the intentions are good, THE NUTTY PROFESSOR of 1996 doesn't capture the manic charisma of the one and only Jerry Lewis whose mugging was more charming than obnoxious.",N/A
594899,"I'm not averse to directors' taking film genres that we are all familiar with and doing new things with them. That is what M. Night Shyamalan is apparently trying to do in Signs, taking the classical alien invasion film and focussing on how one particular family copes with everybody's worst nightmare. It's an interesting idea, and it worked really well for about the first half of the film. Up until that point, we still do not know what or who is leaving those mysterious crop circles. This creates an almost unbearable atmosphere of suspense, which is heightened by Shyamalan's technical skills as a filmmaker. I nearly jumped out of my seat a few times in the scenes in which Mel Gibson's character is walking through his cornfield at night, including one scene in which he catches a glimpse of something out of the corner of his eye. This is the kind of stuff that I was expecting when I paid for my ticket. But then the film gets all messy. First we have an appearance by Shyamalan himself that is absolutely mystifying and seemingly unrelated to the whole plot. In another scene, Gibson's family watches recorded footage on television of an alien walking past terrified schoolchildren in Brazil. The scene is admittedly creepy to say the least, but it has the unsavory consequence of removing most of the suspense from the film. Now we know exactly who is leaving the crop circles; it doesn't really help that Shyamalan's aliens are incredibly unoriginal, indeed like something out of the original Star Trek series. After that, things kind of fall apart. This becomes especially acute when Shyamalan injects his typical spiritual conundrum into the plot, as we learn that Mel Gibson's character is a former priest who lost his faith after his wife was killed in a traffic accident. And unsurprisingly, after we learn this, much of the rest of the film revolves around Gibson regaining his faith in time to save his family. Just exactly what the connection is between Gibson's born again status and his family's survival is uncertain in the film, but the implication is that the former led to the latter. But ignoring the unsuitability of adding this dimension to the plot, the whole logic of Gibson's transformation is even stranger. Remember, his wife's death made him lose his faith; this is obviously a horrible tragedy for anyone to deal with, maybe the worst, but as a Christian Gibson's character would logically be consoled with the knowledge that his wife is in a better place and that he will see her again someday. Now, an alien invasion occurs. Rather than intensifying Gibson's disbelief, as his wife's death did, this unimaginable occurrence causes him to regain his faith. Wow! Maybe I'm being too picky, though. More unforgiveable is Shyamalan's attitude toward the whole plot. He seems to presume that his deep spirituality absolves him from having to come up with an interesting plot resolution. That is the only explanation that I can think of for the ending. It is simply too unconvincing and indeed absurd to be taken seriously. I won't say anymore on that. For me, the half-dozen or so terrifying scenes in the first half of the movie did not make up for the disappointing finale. I was not frightened once in the last hour, only irritated. I'm through with Shyamalan.",Signs

Basically a retelling of the monster in the woods tale, the success of the book is in the complex and textured interweaving of five friends, all linked, all with extraordinary gifts.

228917,"This 1980's version of ""Mansfield Park"" is much truer to the novel than either the 1999 movie or the 2007 TV adaptation of the same name.  Unfortunately, this doesn't mean it's any better. It's just bad in its own, odd way.The most jarring element in this production is Sylvestra Le Touzel's portrayal of Fanny Price. Le Touzel, looking like a Victorian doll or a DW Griffith star, acts as if Fanny just escaped from a mental ward--or should be in one. Throughout the series she makes strange little slashes with her hands whenever she talks.  I think this is supposed to show her earnestness, but instead it starts to look as if she's practicing some bizarre sort of kung fu or as if she's patting an invisible dog.Austen's Fanny Price is gentle, repressed, but upright. Instead, Le Touzel alternates between cold blankness, hysteria (she becomes so shrill and gibbering during her scene with Sir Thomas I ended up fastforwarding the scene), and abruptly shouted ""No's"", making it impossible to understand why so many characters find her endearing. She is both erratic and insufferable. (Le Touzel later redeemed herself as the comic, clothes-minded Mrs. Allen in ""Northanger Abbey"").Most of the other characters, with the exception of Angela Pleasence's deranged Lady Bertram, are well done. Cinematic Mary Crawfords have always fared better than cinematic Fanny Prices, and Jackie Smith-Wood brings wit and warmth to the role.  Bernard Hepton gives Sir Thomas the right amount of gravitas and graciousness. Nicholas Farrell, a longtime favorite, is also very good as Edmund Bertram, despite that character's occasional pomposity.In staying scrupulously faithful to the novel, the script includes virtually all the novel's dialogue, to the detriment of pacing and plot. It PLODS until two thirds of the way through, when it suddenly picks up speed and interest, to the point of cramming in too many events and resolutions all at once.Like so many other reviewers, I am still hoping for a ""Mansfield Park"" that stays true to Austen's characters while streamlining the story and mining all the humor that exists within the text.",Mansfield Park VHS

I didn't see the movie in the theater so when I saw the Blu-Ray on sale for $13.I thought it was a great bargain.  Not so much.The story really moves pretty slow, and the action scenes are few but pretty good.The opening scene (2nd actaull scene) at the Stark Expo (think World Fair) is Tony Stark at his narsasitic high or low depending upon how you want to interpret it. But it is just one example of how they slow the movie down and make it drag along, it takes way too much time.  There were definetly NO Acadamy Awards given for editing or scripts in Iron Man 2.The action starts about 35 to 40 minutes into the movie and its too late to resesetate the toxic script. At this point you finally get to see Ivan Vanko bring on the pain in the Monaco Grand Prix, slicing cars in half with his own Russian version of the ARC reactor and the PLASMA whips he uses to slice throug iorn. It is visually stunning for a few minutes but hardly worth the 30 to 45 minute wait.They spend some time setting up the the stroy arc for S.H.I.E.L.D. and H.A.M.M.E.R as combatent government contractors and this means they have to write Nick Furry into the script, which seems kind of forced and clumsy.  The only elegant part of this is the introduction of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who steals the show in the final 20 minutes with the best action scene of the movie. (There is something hypnotizing about watching an attractive redhead rotating through Judiso space while kicking butt. Oh yeah, did I mention she is in skin tight black leather?)The final 20 minutes of this Blu-Ray along with the extra features like the S.H.I.E.L.D. Data Vault and some of the tech details make it worth keeping.Do I think Super Hero movies need to be ""elegant""? Yes, the writers have very little excuse when they have 30 years of storyline and material to draw on. The first Iron Man was far superior to Iron Man 2 and it was a bit clunky at times.The best part of both of the Iron Man movies is Robert Downey Jr. He seems to be custom made or trained to be Tony Stark.

594960,"Is director M. Night Shyamalan returning to his roots? His first film (which only played at the Toronto Film Festival in 1992), Praying With Anger, explored some religious themes. Signs not only explores them, it exhausts them. If you go into the theater expecting a scary, action-packed chiller with freaky aliens and lots of special effects, you might be looking for other signs, the ones that say EXIT. If however, you're willing to settle for a drama about a man who's lost his faith in God and struggles to find it again when faced with a life and death struggle, you just might like Signs. It's not a bad movie, but it's not what it's being marketed as. I have a feeling that at least one of the crop circles was made by the missing reel that would have made this movie pay off its marketing plot.Billed as a thriller, Signs is set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and stars Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, a recently widowed, recently retired preacher, raising two small children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) and supporting his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) on the sprawling family farm. The signs start to occur right away, when crop circles appear in Hess's cornfield. Without much time to decide whether or not the circles are the work of pranksters, the news media announces that aliens have invaded the world and they're not here to use the telephone.Between the buildup (there are some excellent 'fakeout' scares), there are lots of flashbacks designed to show us why Hess lost his faith. His wife was hit by an inattentive director, er, driver (played by Shyamalan) while out on a late night walk on one of the country roads. Mrs. Hess, of course, hangs on just long enough to deliver some prophetic last words to her husband. (The other unforgivable clich&eacute; in the movie is the asthmatic child locked in a small room, separated from his precious medicine, while the bad guys roam the home.)Like Unbreakable, Shyamalan's second major feature, Signs takes a very long time to get to the point. And just when it seems like things are about to get exciting, it's decided that locking everyone in a dark coal cellar, where nobody (including the audience) can see anything, is a good idea. The cinematography (by the usually very capable Tak Fujimoto), is often too dim, flat, and muddied.You could say Signs is an amalgam of The Apostle, The Blair Witch Project, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Panic Room, and The Natural. I've heard some 'crap circles' grumblings from the movie-going ranks, and someone else compared The Sixth Sense director's batting average to the Phoenix character in Signs: he's a failed baseball player who struck out too many times and has found himself in limbo. Shyamalan hit the ball out of the park with The Sixth Sense, but now he's got two strikes with Unbreakable and Signs. One more and is he out? It may seem unfair to compare his three major motion pictures this way, but that's what moviegoers do. They try to make informed decisions on what they've seen before, before parting with their hard-earned dollars.In Signs, there are some excellent moments of suspense. You hear more than you see, and that works beautifully in connection with the understated, eerie score by James Newton Howard. Unfortunately, there are long stretches of downtime and distracting flashbacks between the moments of suspense. It's too bad, because Shyamalan is talented, and I know he is capable of ratcheting up the suspense levels to all-time highs. But in this case, it looks like he fell in love with the idea of ""two kinds of people"" (you have to see the movie to get that) and forgot he was making Signs for the general masses.There are bits and pieces of a good, scary story here, and the cast is definitely above par. Gibson paired with Shyamalan, and the promise of creepy aliens, is bound to bring in some dollar signs at the box office. Whether or not it will have legs depends on whether or not the audiences will accept that the sci-fi element is just a facade for the movie's true wares: a ponderous sermon on spirituality rising above the threat of 'the devil'.",Signs

1622893,"Its impossible to make a movie about the tsunami and include each and every facet of destruction and devastation.  This movie focuses on one happy foreign family on vacation visiting from Japan.The movie starts very slowly with hardly any dialogue, and at times is filmed as if with a hand held video camera.  Knowing this movie is about the tsunami you know it's not going to be happy for very long and without much wasted time the tsunami quickly hits.  The story continues, long and drawn out.  The movie is quiet, nothing but ruin as far as the eye can see.  Lotst of wasted time and fast forward moments.The movie picks up more when they finally get to the makeshift hospital scenes, but again, not a whole lot happens there either. You aren't provided with much back story, who the people are, or where these hospitals are located. You have no idea where all of the doctors, nurses, and volunteers came from.The wife is on deaths door one minute, goes into surgery and is on an airplane home the next.  No time frames are given.While there isn't much dialogue, there certainly isn't any bad language. There is however, scary moments of being swept away to sea, dead bodies, and open flesh wounds.  Gaping flesh wounds really.I certainly wasn't impressed with this movie.  I learned nothing more about the tsunami, the destruction, the death toll, the miracles, the hope, the survival, the rebuilding, the volunteers, etc.  It seemed more like it was thrown together in haste to be the first movie of its kind to air.  And then of course there were the instances of bad acting.I really wanted to like it, and be especially sensitive to the story subject matter, but I just didn't like it at all.  I would not recommend this one.  Do some research, and find a more accurate, perhaps historical documentary on the tsunami.",Impossible

786758,"Early on in ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" Diane Lane's character Frances, a writer dumped by her husband and now on a gay tour of Tuscany, helps out a fellow American by writing a postcard to send to his mother.  He takes one look at her flowery, overwrought prose and throws it down in disgust, saying, ""Mom will never believe I wrote that!"" Like the words on that postcard, there are many cringe-worthy moments in this film.We get a homogenized, romanticized view of Tuscany, the way most middle-aged American women who feel unloved by their cloddy spouses might imagine it.  Stereotypes abound--there's the red-hot younger Italian lover (named Marcello, of course) whose broken English is supposed to be charming; the free-spirited, batty English woman (the fabulous Lindsay Duncan trapped inside a cliche) who takes joy in shocking the locals; the star-crossed young lovers; the elderly man still pining for his dead love; and the sassy yet approachable gay friend.Diane Lane is stunning as usual, but she mugs for the camera and hams it up a la Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan in too many instances, as if the audience might be too stupid to pick up on nuanced emotion.  She's played unhappy characters of this age before, and much more subtly and convincingly, in ""Unfaithful"" and ""A Walk on the Moon.""The views of Tuscany are gorgeous and motivation enough to make you want to drop everything and run off to Italy, even if the film itself is a forgettable, sometimes fun romp.",N/A

In over 70 years of moviemaking, the bloody vampire has been played by everyone from Bela Lugosi to Leslie Nielsen; Gerard Butler to Frank Langella; Christopher Lee to David Peel; and so on and so on.  Now, Christopher Atkins from THE BLUE LAGOON plays the vampire's son, a blond charmer who doesn't really want to be a vampire, and who is mooning over his lost love from 500 years ago.  She is now embodied in an art restorer's persona, played lazily and lifeless by Stacey Travis.  Doug Wert plays the bad vampire as if he was in a Saturday Night Live skit, which would have worked had the movie had its tongue in its cheek. Alas, though, it tries to be a Gothic romance horror film, and doesn't capture the essence of any of them.Burdened with repetitive flashback scenes that tell us how Atkins and Wert became vampires, the movie lopes along at a snail's pace, and the climax is amazingly funny.

Charley (Steve Coogan) and Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) are step siblings who have a child together, except Charley thinks it was aborted. The child was put up for adoption. Oh yeah, Charley is gay and Mamie is having an affair with her masseuse. Charley believes his partner Gil (David Sutcliffe) is the biological father of  the child of a lesbian couple through sperm he had donated. A bad independent film maker (Jesse Bradford) convinces Mamie to go look for her son so he can film it, even though the son doesn't want to be found. Meanwhile Otis (Jason Ritter) rich son of Tom Arnold is gay...he thinks, but scores with Jude (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who also sleeps with dad, and becomes pregnant seeking the advice of Mamie who works at the clinic.The film attempts to be clever with printed material to the side, the way VH-1 tries to be clever with &#34;Pop Up Videos&#34; except VH-1 is better. The writers try to be funny with dysfunctional people in unusual relationships, but fails due to the complexity of the plot.

I am informed enough to realize that much of the information presented in the film was cherry-picked, which resulted in a heavily slanted take on events. It's not that it's necessarily wrong, but there's always two sides to a story and this film only shows you one. It is entertaining at times and if you're a Michael Moore fan you'll enjoy it. To call this film a documentary is a stretch though. I have to agree with those that are calling it propaganda. As a moderate Democrat (I don't HATE Bush - I just don't care for his policies very much, and I'm hoping for the best in Iraq.) I found it somewhat repulsive to be associated with this film and embarrassed that Moore was displayed so prominently during the convention. Looking back on the election I think that this film worked against us, firing up the Democratic base, who were already going to vote against Bush, and repelling everyone else. In the end, I think that history will not look very kindly on Mr. Moore. A deceitful ideologue at best. A traitor at worst. 1 stars for skillful manipulation. 1 star for content.",Fahrenheit 9/11
1167898,"""Never Cry Werewolf"" is the very definition of horror lite.  I'm about sick and tired of PG-13 DVD's being advertised as ""unrated"".  Don't get me wrong, this isn't an unwatchable mess of a film that will leave you angry about the 90 minutes of your life you can never get back, but if you watch werewolf movies for gore, nudity, and terror than don't hesitate to pass this by.  This is another intended for the tween crowd.The lead actress is one thing this flick has going for it.  Doe-eyed brunette cutie-pie Nina Dobrev pretty much carries this entire film and she does a pretty solid job at it.  Geek demi-icon Kevin Sorbo (Hercules The Legendary Journeys) is slightly amusing as a celebrity outdoorsman tapped by our heroine to help her take out her new neighbor, who for some reason can turn into a werewolf at will by wrapping a strip of some pervert's neckskin around his knuckles.  Yeeeeaaaah, the werewolf mythology on this one is shaky at best.  Also, he can bite people and apparently turn them into living lycanthropic plastic surgery disasters.  Whatever.  Throw in a pathetic love interest with awful emo hair, an annoying little brother, the creepiest dog this side ofCujo, and a pot of eyeball stew and you've got a lame-but-watchable horror romp that even my two year old son laughed at.  A lot.  There's some blood splatter going on, but very little actual gore unless you count a wolf exploding into translucent goo as gore.  I do not.While ""Never Cry Werewolf"" offers some creeps, a hot protagonist, and a pretty cool werewolf (realistic: no.  Cool: yes.) there is not enough to scratch that horror itch.  There is however, some cannibalism which can only help.  The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good.  But probably half of the scenes are ripped off wholesale from other films.  That is bad.  Couple making out in car hears noise, boy steps out to investigate upon girl's urging.  Gee, I wonder what happens next?  Lameness, that's what.  Telepathic werewolf: why?!?!  Reincarnated lost love?  That's not even a werewolf movie convention, that's eithera mummyor acrummy vampire flick!  Come on!  They even rip offHitchcock, though I imagine a lot of people will think it'sShia Leboufbeing robbed.  I can say that I've genuinely never seen a werewolf take a hostage to use as a human shield to protect himself from the assault of a teenage girl before.  I wish I could still say that.  So much wrong.As bad as this movie is, it is still better thanCursed, and that one had gore.  There is some smirk-worthy humor, a few genuinely creepy bits -most involving that damn dog-, and did I mention the attractiveness of the lead actress?  All-around a watchable movie, but just don't go in thinking you're getting a full-on unrated frightfest.  This is a bare-bones release, but I don't imagine there'd be any special features I'd actually want to watch anyway.  Have a look if you're in a light-hearted mood and have seen every other werewolf movie.  And if you have seen every other werewolf movie; my condolences on having sat through the unspeakably terrible Howling sequels.

The plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship. The story line is totally different and therefore some of Porter's original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of Sammy Cahn and James Van Huesen which do not live up to Porter's quality.The best examples I can give is the fact that there is no Evangelist so the title song ""Anything Goes"" turns into a second act number, sung by Mitzi and chorus (with horrific word changes) and ""Blow Gabriel Blow"" becomes a finale in the broadway show (sung by the four main characters) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line.If you haven't seen it on stage it's pleasant enough, but if you're expecting the broadway show it's a major disappointment.",N/A

1493936,"Being one of those low budget independent movies, only those who purposely seek these things out with some hatred towards Hollywood movies will brag on and on about how this is supposed to be an ingenious masterpeice. Well, the director should have taken some tips from those Hollyweed movies and given this one here a much faster pace instead of boring you to tears for the most part.The plot is rather interesting tho, a 19 year old girl hears on the radio that a new star has just been found in the sky that may be able to support life. As she looks in the sky while driving (drunk I think) she crashes her car into a family of 3. She goes to prison for 4 years and when she is released, she seeks out the man who survived the crash, but lost his wife and young child in the process. He has no idea who she is when she knocks on his door, but instead of saying what she wanted, she tells him she is a cleaner and he hires her to clean his house. They end up falling in love but she doesn't want to proceed with the relationship because she has not told him the truth. All while this is happening, the discovery of the new star is discovered to be another Earth that they call Earth II. There is a contest online for someone to win a trip on a shuttle to go and visit the planet, and the main actresses dream is to go and explore space, or the new planet where scientists have discovered Earth II is a planet where everyone on Earth I had a double, where everything had been the exact same events on both Earths until the time of discovering each other, 4 years before hand when it was first announced.You can probably already guess how this movie ends. It is fairly predictable. But seeing through the idea of trying to gain interest in some sort of Sci-Fi idea of two planets, it's more of a story of a woman who causes a tragic accident, meets the man she killed the wife and kid of,accidentally gets involved with him, and their sad/depressed lives change them into more happier people... and then, later, you can probably predict what happens in the end.To me tho, the premise and story are far more interesting then actually having to sit through this. For the most part, I was bored and yawning while my girlfriend told me to shut-up and hope it gets better. It doesn't. There is no pace, it drags on, there is no fun, comedy or anything really of any entertainment value. It's also one of those movies that must not have run long enough to call it a full length one, so inserted is a bunch of useless scenes that are not needed to do anything other then make the movie seem longer. I wanted to bleach my own eyes having to sit through that useless dribble of filler. My girlfriend was loving the cheaply made CGI scenes of Earths sky showing another Earth in the sky like the moon, but I have seen it done before, and much better, and was not at all impressed by it.I can definitely see other people enjoying this movie, for various reasons, but for people like me who like something about a movie to be memorable, or something that makes a movie burn into your mind and make you remember it, this movie just failed to leave me with anything other then feelings of being bored and wanting to reach for the skip button, fast forward, or the off switch.So, keep in mind, this is one of those independent movies that people praise because it's not half as bad as most indie-films and it seems artsy-fartsy enough to be praised by someone who would turn their nose up at average entertainment movies because they are given more of a budget to work with then these kind of films and would rather support blah blah blah blah... you know the story, it's too boring to keep going on with.I'd rather have read this as a book than watched it, it really did show scenes of this girl standing still for a few minutes, while you guess what is going through her head, she may as well have had a voice over saying things like ""I saw the dust on the bench projecting a light yellow as the setting sun dripped through the old stain glass windows that didn't look like they had been washed since Bill Clinton last slept with his wife and didn't think of some other, more youthful, woman's melons that had no wrinkles or a stench of Rosie O'Donnell's breath attached to them"".Also, if you are expecting this to be a sci-fi movie, guess again. It's a drama, the Earth II thing could easily be taken out and this would still be the same story, just with an alternate ending, possibly a thriller, which would have been more entertaining if you ask me.See it if it interests you, but I really wouldn't expect too much from it if you think it's going to be absolutely brilliant.",N/A

However, that constitutes a line of demarcation that will dictate your response to this film, as evidenced by the other reviews for this 2006 film.  If you do not like tongue-in-cheek horror films or think that this one walks too fine of a line in that regard, then you are not going to like this one and you should know that from the start.  Still, the cast is decent and the women all act sexy rather than just look sexy, which is why the aforementioned drunken frat boys will love this film.Ellen Morris (Blythe Metz) and her husband William (Luciano Szafir) are trying to conceive a child, so she orders a fertility mask that turns out to be to creepy.  The next thing we know Bill is driving Ellen to a mental hospital because she insists she has been attacked by the ""Nightmare Man.""  Then the car runs out of gas and Ellen is left alone.  For a while wirter-driector Rolfe Kanefsky (maker of such unrated driected to video fare as ""The Erotic Misadventures of the Invisible Man"", ""Jacqueline Hyde"") is covering the same ground as last year's Horrorfest entry ""Penny Dreadful,"" as the Nightmare man shows up and tries to kill Ellen.  But in fleeing from the killer Ellen stumbles upon a cabin in which two couples, Mia (Tiffany Shepis) & Ed (Jack Sway) and Trinity (Hanna Putnam) & Jack (James Ferris), are  engaging in their own version of couples therapy.  Now we know that Ellen will not just be the appetizer on this mania's menu and the killing can begin in earnest.  The problem is when we get to the final act and the film reverses engines full from tongue-in-cheek to a scene that many viewers might find disturbing (if not offensive).  I was giving the film the benefit of the doubt to that point, but I had to round down because I thought it was way too late to try and have it both ways in this movie.As you watch this film the identity of the Nightmare Man is so obvious that it becomes too obvious, which makes you question what is really going on.  There does indeed turn out to be a twist, but then the twist gets reversed and the movie gets derailed.  Viewers not in the drunken frat boy category are going to be rolling their eyes at this point and inquire as the cognitive processes of the director.  Otherwise, this is a film that wants to have its sex and violence too, represented by the cutting back and forth between Ellen being attacked in the woods and the game of Truth or Dare being played in the cabin.  Then there is the way sex (that is to say, nudity) are used to set up the first death, even before the victim says their ironic last words.  But for me the burning question is this: I understand that anybody can pick up a knife and figure out what to do with it, but how many people could pick up a bow and arrow they find in the woods and start shooting rapid fire bullseyes?  (Amazing what you will focus on as being unbelievable in a horror film, huh?).This is one of only three Horrorfest DVDs this time around that actual have bonus features beyond the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes, which speaks more to Kanfesky and Shepis being old hands in the horror genre than anything else.  There is a ""Flubbing a Nightmare"" gag reel that is pretty lame, some extended scenes that show nothing important was left on the cutting room floor (but do give you another chance to see Shepis's strip tease and Putnam's fake orgasm), and a stills gallery.  ""Creating a Nightmare"" is the standard ""making of"" featurette and then we get ""Tiffany's Behind the Scenes"" bit (actually introduced as ""Tiffany's Behind........the Scenes""), which is pretty much what you would expect if you give Tiffany Shepis a video camera during the film's down time.  Shepis, Kanfesky and producer Esther Goodstein laugh their way through the commentary track.  Final Note: If you are a Richard Moll fan you are going to have to wait for the end for him to pop up (Why is he even in the movie?  Because he lives in Big Bear where the movie was shot).  Tonight's offering: ""The Deaths of Ian Stone.""""Has a frat boy point of view,Likes its women cute and nude,Almost went direct to DVD.Nightmare Man, please don't ask,When a mask is not a mask.Nightmare Man, a sequel should not be planned.""",Nightmare Man Theatrical Release

596968,"When it comes to pure charisma, the only Hong Kong actor who matches with Jackie Chan is Chow Yun-Fat (who is, overall, probably a better actor). What is it about Chan that appeals to so many people? It's not only that he does all his stunts for real, but he seems like a natural, care-free, fun-loving kind of guy. In every film he's been in, you can't help but notice his enthusiasm, even when he's starring in crap.And thus we segue to The Tuxedo, a sort-of spy spoof which Chan stars as Jimmy Tong, a reckless taxi driver with a crush on a woman working in an art exhibition. Because of his top-notch driving skills, he's hired as Clark Devlin's (Jason Isaacs) personal driver. Devlin is one suave fellow, with a fine tuxedo to boot, but he falls into a coma after an incident involving an explosive.Tong, as his good friend and employee, feels obligated to find out what happened to his boss so he dresses himself in Devlin's tuxedo, which apparently enables the wearer superhuman ability and agility. Posing as Devlin, Tong partners with a secret agent named Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) to expose a crime to poison the world's water supply.For a good twenty or so minutes, the film is actually pretty enjoyable fluff, with a cool car &quot;chase,&quot; which is really just Chan driving real fast, but fun to watch, nonetheless. However, once Hewitt is introduced as Chan's partner, the whole thing goes downhill with mindless blather about water. It seems the villain intends to poison the world's water supply so that only his bottled water is safe.Utter stupidity of the plan aside (poison water, ecosystem...dead, anyone?), it's just not the kind of set-up we want for a Chan flick. This isn't the first film he's posed as a secret agent (see the far superior First Strike or Who am I?) but this time around, it ultimately drags the picture down. For one thing, the film's most interesting character isn't Chan, it's Isaacs' Clark Devlin, who really is a cool and suave individual (Isaac himself has always been a very underrated actor).Chan is his enthusiastic self as usual, but when it comes to performing nifty stunts, forget it, the stuff here looks too manipulated, which entirely defeats the charm of watching Jackie Chan take on countless opponents. The humor isn't very good, either, with relentlessly predictable jokes (&quot;nice rack&quot;) and an astonishingly digressive segment involving Chan performing like James Brown, which is cringe-worthy, to say the least.Last, and possibly least, there's Jennifer Love Hewitt, who's a fairly pretty actress and as far as genuine talent goes...well, I've seen much worse (Denise Richards, I'm looking at you). But here, she's just annoying, called on by the script to do nothing but whine and complain. Worse yet, the movie never even opts to give us a good cleavage shot, which might have made the more annoying bits bearable.As far as story goes, the plot is lame, the villains make zero impression, and the gadgets...well, the tuxedo IS the gadget and it's not a very impressive one, at that. For superior martial arts entertainment, check out First Strike or Who am I?* 1/2 out of *****",The Tuxedo
508221,"Jean Rollin was never a good film maker, he is an artist with an artist's eye.  The best asset a film maker has is to know what works and what doesn't and edits, artists don't edit. The writing is always interesting but the poor script skills hinder a director.  What talent he lacked as a film maker was made up for with his artist's eye.  He has an artist's eye for recognizing beauty in the female form, not as easy as you think.  His artist's eye is also on display in his films with the images and settings.  Jean Rollin recognized his lack of talent as a film maker, there is not a lot of dialogue, he predominantly told his stories with the visuals, although you can tell he thought of himself as a poet also, some of the dialogue in his movies is practically prose.  As a matter of fact many characters who appear throughout a movie might only have a sentence or two in the whole movie.There is no doubt that the only reason much of his early stuff even makes it to film is the nudity and realizing the sexual fantasies of many regarding horror films.  He took the nudity and sexual fantasies past the point where other horror films stopped.  Much of what he does in his films you would not even see in porn now days after their self imposed restrictions in the late 70's with the advent of video tape and the subsequent fear of a government crack down of the industry.  This is why you don't see rape in porn.  Some of the early porn videos had rape scenes.The story in Shiver is not bad but leaves a lot to be desired as a script.  The story's true purpose is to realize his desire for nudity and the aforementioned sexual fantasies.  The only worthy thing about Shiver is the beauty of Sandra Julien and the images and settings.  I imagine much of the setting doesn't even exist anymore.  Jean Rollin must have done a lot of driving around to find his settings.  Recommended for only the most die hard 60's and 70's horror film fans.",N/A
1063924,"""The Big Cube"" stars screen glamour queen Lana Turner. Although not her last film, she was past her days as a box office star and had already begun accepting a few low-quality roles. This one is slightly-less laughable than ""Trog."" Lana plays Adriana Roman, an actress who has retired to marry wealthy Charles Winthrop (Dan O'Herlihy). Charles also has beautiful daughter, Lisa (Karin Mossberg), who inexplicably speaks with a Swedish accent. Lisa has unknowingly fallen in with a bad crowd that party and use LSD; the ringleader, Johnny (George Chakiris), sees Lisa as his new bankroll and begins to romance her. When Adriana & Charles have an accident at sea, the widowed Adriana is left as the one who must decide whether Lisa gets her inheritance or not. Since Lisa has chosen to be with a druggie, Adriana turns her down. Johnny attempts to gaslight Adriana with LSD. You'll have to watch to find out the chilling conclusion! So much is laughable here, but Lana is a trooper and does the best that she can with this campy story and poor script. Lana still looks lovely, even though she is weighted down in some pretty gaudy gowns by famous designer Travilla and some hairpieces that would be enough to give most women head trauma! Even more amazing on the hairpieces is that they don't even come close to matching the color of Lana's hair. I kept wondering if this was intentional or some new two-toned hair fad of the 60's that I'd never heard about. It is amazing what a solid cast this movie has, too; Oscar winner Chakiris (""West Side Story""), Oscar nominated Turner, Richard Egan, and Dan O'Herlihy (who had played Turner's love interest in ""Imitation of Life""). Apparently the majority of the budget went to the stars' salaries and not the script. And let's not forget Pamela Rodgers as Bibi, the bimbo fun-loving friend of Lisa. Pamela went on to bigger fame in the hit TV series ""Laugh-In."" The psychedelic effects are fab, too, and there's plenty of drugs, sex (well, as much as is allowed in 1968), and rock & roll music (or something like it) to make this one the hit of a trashy movie party! A theatrical trailer is also included. I suggest getting the ""Women in Peril"" box set that also includes ""Trog"" (Joan Crawford) and ""Caged"" (Eleanor Parker); it averages out to about $9 a movie...what a value!",The Big Cube

750438,"I wasn't much impressed with the first ""Saw"" but now I realize the first one was a masterpiece comparing to the sequel. The second ""Saw"" is not boring or dumb - it's rather interesting to watch and to follow the story-line. It's interesting to expect the upcoming plot-twist and identification of a killer. But from this kind of a film you always expect something more than just being an ordinary thriller. Unfortunately here you don't get anything except a certain number of used cliches. In the end I got so many questions I didn't know whom to ask. I'm not going to ask now not to spoil the movie for you, I'll just say there are so many flaws in the film... Its creators didn't even try to cover them up. OK, every film has some, and I usually tend not to notice them, but here it was just outrageous.There are successful movies with just a couple of main characters (like ""Saw"", ""Cube"" or ""Blair Witch Project""). When sequel is being made filmmakers stick much more characters into it because they just don't know what to do with this amount of film time. They don't have a talent (like makers of the original) to make a picture with two main characters so it could be intense and gripping and thrilling. It's easier to kill another character every 10 minutes than to keep a viewer breathless for hour and a half, concentrating on just two persons.In ""Saw 2"" when I saw this bunch of people obviously going to get murdered, I understood right away - this won't be a talented thriller.Yes, it has its tense moments, thrill and gore, but as I said, from this kind of film you expect a lot more.A definite potboiler.",Saw II

Killer Angels the book gets a strong 5 star rating, Gettysburg the movie gets a tepid 2 star ranking at best. Gettysburg is not nearly as good as Glory, but it is mildly better than Gods and Generals.The history of the Civil War is replete with interesting stories to tell, why can't the people at Turner Productions hire the best directors and cast to do the job right instead of cheaply and swiftly ?

705008,"There is only one reason to watch this movie: there are maybe 2 minutes worth of cut scenes that you CANNOT watch anywhere eles scattered throughout the &quot;Death&quot; segment of the film that take place within the T.V. series. The rest of the movie is scattered scenes from the T.V. series, (the &quot;Death&quot; segment) and the first 26 minutes of &quot;End Of Evangelion&quot; (the &quot;Rebirth&quot; segment).The scenes that can only be found on &quot;Death &amp; Rebirth&quot; are: Asuka talking to Kaji just before we meet them for the first time in the series, Shinji playing the string quartet at school and later being joined by the other three children who pilot the Evas (including Shinji's guy friend, whose name I have forgotten, as it's been quite some time since I watched the series, who pilots the fourth Eva only once when it is possessed by an angle and must be destroyed,) and they come in one at a time and play violins, and there is minimal dialoge spoken by Shinji and Asuka. Then there is Kaji's death scene. Actually we don't exactly see him die. He is shown standing outside by a huge fan, and then he looks at us and says,&quot;You're late.&quot; We don't see who comes to meet him. Fade to black, and in the English version we hear him shot, and then Shinji tells Asuka Kaji is dead. In the Japanese version we hear him slapped, and then Shinji tells Asuka Kaji is gone. This to me would seem to suggest that Kaji met Misato one last time, and then she slaps him and he leaves for good, while in the English version he meets an undercover contact who kills him. In both versions we then see Asuka call Shinji a liar.These scenes are the only reason to buy the VHS version of this film, and that's only depending on how badly you want to see the few minutes of new footage you can't see anywhere eles, and only if you don't have a DVD player. Rent it if you can find it at any video store, unless they don't have the language version of your choice. On the DVD there is a commentary option where you can listen to the thoughts of Amanda Winn, English voice actor of Rei, and two other guys who worked on it. The commentary is insightful and funny, (they apologize for using levity and say it is only to relive the depression of working on such a heavy series,) and the part of the commentary that runs through the &quot;Death&quot; segment can only be heard on the&quot;Death &amp; Rebirth&quot; disk. However, the commentary that runs through the &quot;Rebirth&quot; segment is the same commentary that plays over the beginning of &quot;End Of Evangelion&quot;. Also there is an option only on the &quot;D&amp;R&quot; disk that lets you access infromation while you watch the film for anyone still confused about anything.If the scant new footage that can only be found here, &quot;Death&quot; commentary, and information menu aren't enough to spark your interest, watch the T.V. series, (the first 24 episodes, anyway,) then skip this and go directly to &quot;End Of Evangelion&quot;.",N/A

As a longtime Vikings fan, I'm really disappointed that this greatest games collection doesn't include anything from the Super Bowl years. In fact, not only does this set not include any Fran Tarkenton games, it doesn't even include any Tommy Kramer or Daunte Culpepper games (Kramer was on the roster for one of them, but Wade Wilson was the starter).As someone who has followed the Vikings since they were perennial Super Bowl contenders, I honestly believe that only two of these games qualify as two of their ""greatest"" games. At the very least, the Kramer to Rashad miracle game versus Cleveland in 1980 should have been included in this set (lots of copies exist among collectors). The Vikings also played 3 great playoff games against the Rams in the 1970s. At least one of those should have qualified, not to mention playoff wins over the Cowboys and Redskins during that same time.I am glad they saw fit to finally include a Vikings set (How about a team history DVD, too?), but ignoring the Purple People Eaters is a huge snub to longtime Viking fans. That era DID matter. Two stars for the two games that rightfully belong in this set.12/28/08 Vikings 20 Giants 19The Vikings clinch their division against the Giants' second string. Hardly one of the greatest games in Vikings history. Also available on iTunes.11/04/07 Vikings 35 Chargers 17This one probably deserves to be in a greatest games set.

The Vikings held the Cowboys scoreless after the first quarter. I don't know if anything from the Jeff George era belongs in a Vikings greatest games collection.01/10/1999 Vikings 41 Cardinals 21Something from the 1998 season needed to be included in this set, but this divisional round playoff game wasn't necessarily a great game. The Vikings led 24-7 at halftime and won rather easily. A better choice might have been the Vikings Monday night victory over the Packers during the regular season.01/09/1988 Vikings 36 49ers 24Okay, this one does qualify as one of the Vikings greatest games (IMO). The Vikings upset the heavily favored 49ers in the divisional round of the playoffs. Unfortunately, Darrin Nelson came up a step short in the conference finale the next week versus the Redskins.Update:I went ahead and purchased this set because I'm an idiot, and because I didn't already have two of the games included in it.  It came today with an intriguing surprise.  The cover of the DVD case says that this is the Viking's ""5 Greatest Games Volume 1"".

They are placed in an isolated camp!!! called district 9. And many humans do not want them there, but socialist government( you will discover this as you watch) wishes to offer eaual opportunity to these aliens. So, plans are drawn to move aliens from district 9 to another location but this move CANNOT be done, unless aliens agree and sign moving documents!!!! A group of government employees are assigned to go in district 9 and get aliens sign these documents. Mind you that all these are happening in reality show style.

Meanwhile, government is very much interested in this guys mutation into alien from human form. So, they are after him, while he is trying to help this one alien to fix his ship. Aliens has superior weapons and huge fire power. Easily they can over power humans but no alien ever touches any gun. Some reason, they are extremely peaceful, yet have those deadly weapons!!!!, our guy, who is muating into alien can now use alien weapons since these weapons bio-genetically locked. Anotherwords, you must be alien to use them.

1082630,"I know, I know, this is low-budget zombie cinema so why harp on the use of ideas that have been used and re-used hundreds of times before?  In fact, why watch these type of films in the first place if you're going to be overly critical right?  True, that's a good couple of points except... at one time, independent horror films weren't only awesome BUT also original and scary.  I suppose every time I pick up one of these movies I hope to find something different or special... oh well, maybe next time huh?  Automaton Transfusion is one of the newest(seems like there's at least 3 more every Tuesday release day) independent attempts at the zombie genre.  Sporting the controversial(to me at least) ""running dead"" approach and a filming style that could make for Epileptic seizures at worst and mild nausea at best, Automaton Transfusion features a military experiment gone awry(shocking!) and a town overrun by the infected for our protagonists to escape from.  As I said at the top, pretty basic stuff, with our leads being an even more basic mish-mash of high school types(i.e. cheerleader, outcast, overweight loser, lone black guy in entire town, etc.) that you've seen plenty of times before.  The gore runs from good, to at times even inspired(a torn off lower jaw still has me wondering how it was done so well?) but is so overly absurd that it's never really gross, but it's still entertaining(by the way, the scene on the cover unfortunately never occurs).  The acting... is to be expected for this type of picture, not always bad, but never really good either(probably a little better than most of it's kind though).  The zombies actually come off much more like the infected from the 28 Days Later franchise, mostly just regular looking people, except covered in blood and running around biting the living.  The pluses about the film are that it hits the ground running(pun intended) and doesn't bore us with too much buildup and other unnecessary drama(it knows what it is), basically just running from one undead attack into another(in a nicely scant 75 minute package), and the scene where a zombie rips an unborn baby from a mothers stomach and devours it in front of her(I'm a horror fan... what do you want me to say?  Loved it!).  I had high expectations for this and maybe that's why I'm so hard on it upon my initial viewing(but maybe not either)?  For fans of newer low-budget and independent zombie cinema this should provide enough goods to entertain, but still is probably only worth a rental first.  *SPOILER ALERT*  I never give away spoilers in reviews but this one is big enough that I figure I should(not to mention I kinda wish I knew about it before buying)... the movie ends with a ""To Be Continued.""

Yeah, it's great to have the movie in widescreen, but at the very least would it have hurt them to include the trailer?I also think, if the recorded material of Janet Waldo as Judy does indeed exist, an ""alternate audio cut"" should've been made available as a bonus feature. It's already odd enough to have a different Elroy; but knowing that a Janet Waldo Judy was a possibility, it's a shame to not have it.Then again, the price of the DVD is really low, so I guess we get what we paid for.",N/A
941907,"I watched the 2007 adaptation ofFanny Hilla couple of days ago, and though it had some issues in terms of plot, the movie itself was beautifully filmed. In this older version starring Lisa Raines in the title role, I actually enjoyed the dialogue (which is witty and funny), and the over-the-top bedroom antics, but felt the entire production was let down by the poor picture quality. The DVD I watched had extremely poor picture quality - the picture lacked sharpness and clarity, and appeared like it was lifted straight off a VHS with no attempt being made to digitally remaster it. Very disappointing, considering the story itself was entertaining and well-written, not to mention credibly acted to superior comic effect.Having never watched the original release on VHS, I have no idea how much has been edited from this version, though I did sense some choppiness in the plot - perhaps due to bits being cut out of this release. I can't imagine why - certainly, it can't be due to censorship concerns, considering the abundant nudity throughout this movie - bare breasts compete with bare bottoms and much more! Oh well, at least it afforded me an opportunity to watch this older version and compare it to the 2007 adaptation. On the whole, I'd suggest this as a rental until a far superior version is released.",Fanny Hill
263038,"Well, it took me a good ten years, but I finally finished watching this movie. I have owned it in various avatars, but everytime I used to start ""Cleopatra"", I would lose it by the half hour mark, and would be fast asleep around the forty-five minute mark. This has happened at LEAST five times that I can remember.This is not a bad movie, but you will HAVE to invest yourself in it for the first hour if you really want to finish it. It doesn't quite grab you as other historical films from the genre (if you like 'The Ten Commandments' and 'The Bible', this movie isn't as light watching as those are). I also initially had a problem with Elizabeth Taylor. In some scenes it really looked like she spent the night out drinking WAY too much alcohol, and she tried using loads of make up to cover the damage. I don't know - she didn't work for me at least 50% of the time.Yes, if you use all the politically correct definitions under which Hollywood functions, this is a 'classic' in every sense of the word. After watching this, you should revisit the made-for-TV movie 'Cleopatra', starring Billy Zane and Leonor Varela. You judge, and tell me which is the better film. I could finish the latter in one sitting.I think the problem is that the script here is very slow, and Eliza's Cleopatra isn't very alluring - its quite hard to care for a creature such as her, and she came across as rather vampish and trashy at times. I doubt the real Cleopatra was like this, but what do I know. I'm no historian.Everyone has very polarized views on this movie decades after its' release. It took me years to watch it to the end. Was it worth it? Yes, I think so. Its a passably good film with lots of costumes and fanfare, but to me it lacked what makes a 'true' classic - and thats soul. Just my two cents.",N/A

81420,"After watching Good Will Hunting, I was struck by two similarities to other works of fiction (in this case, novels) that I had previously read: J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"", and Stephen King's ""Rage"".  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy either of those efforts, and didn't take to ""Hunting"" any more pleasantly.For a basic plot summary, this film centers on young Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a mathematical genius (of savant proportions) who spends his time mopping floors at a local university before solving a complex equation left on a blackboard and catching the eye of a math professor (Stellan Skarsgrd).  However, Will is a troubled young man who lacks motivation, along with a history of violence, and thus is sent to therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), who tries a rather unorthodox approach to salvaging the boy's unique talents.Although I can see why some people would like this film much more than I (due to the deep psychological themes), I have never been one much for the ""bratty youngster needs a character treatise to understand what he is going through"" type of storytelling.  To me, Will Hunting was an arrogant, unmotivated jerk in the beginning of the film, then a whole bunch of psychological terms/scenarios were thrown around, and now suddenly I'm supposed to believe that everything is okay?  Not quite.To me, the most interesting scenes in this film revolved around Hunting's potential girlfriend (played by Minnie Driver).  I actually felt that her relationship with Will (and her character altogether) were the high points of the film, not the ""tense"" client-therapist scenes that were supposed to steal the show.I realize that I am probably in the minority here, but I really can't recommend this film to anyone besides those who love to be wowed by psychological scenarios/situations.  I found it be pretentious and bloated to be otherwise.",Good Will Hunting
1404064,"I have to admit, I'm not the biggest Final Destination fan but I have watched the first and the second and I love them both. I heard it started going downhill after and I'm starting to believe it. If people are willing to give this movie a 5 star review then that can only mean the last two must have been extremely awful because this one is the easily and by far the worst Final Destination movie I've seen. Let me rephrase that: this is the only Final Destination movie I've seen that I didn't like. If you've seen the first and the second (or just the first is enough), then you won't be surprised, you won't be engaged, you won't even be interested in knowing what happens next as it's so obvious. Characters are uninteresting and straightforward. Movie does not even attempt to add anything extra to the series and seem to be more like a remake (or spiritual replacement) of the first movie. Put it this way, story and character wise is plain boring (unless this is your first entry into the series).With all that said, reason why I'm giving this a 2 star compared to a 1 star is the first action scene and the 3D effects. Both were pretty well. The first scene won't blow your mind away but it was definitively entertaining to watch. The use of 3D effects really added a lot to the scenes of interest and I think it had one of the best uses of it. Although out of the movie, maybe you get 15-20 minutes of good 3d action.Conclusion: If you watched the first or the second movie and you don't care about 3d, I highly recommend skipping this movie. Not worth your time. If you've never watched a Final Destination movie then this one could be interesting for you. If you only care about 3D, maybe wait till the price drops to $5-10 or something.",Final Destination 5 (DVD)

1159872,"When will this long and tedious journey ever end? Like all good new ideas, Lost started off brightly and got us all hooked... great characters, bizarre happenings, inexplicable coincidences, amazing miracles, the lot.But that was hundreds of years ago. And yet here we are, still watching little groups of two and three characters marching about in that now oh-so-familiar undergrowth, holding flaming torches above their heads on God knows what missions... find the hut, find Jake, watch out for The Others, now watch out for the Other-Others with machine guns blah blah blah blah blah.And still the flashbacks continue. And, in yet another twist, flash forwards as well. We're leaping back and forth in time, with each character getting their 'turn' every week, in an ever-growing confusing tangle of plotlines and sub-plots until we feel like we're drowning in a giant bowl of spaghetti.And even now it's not over!

476329,"Yeah, I know I'm a little late on this but in 1999 when I saw this movie for the first time I was so disgusted I promised never to watch it again. Well, after a couple of years on DVD I decided to give this one another chance.  It really didn't deserve it.The story is very simplistic.  Two Jedi Knights (Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi) are called to settle a trade dispute.  The planet Naboo has been invaded by the greedy Trade Federation and they demand that Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) sign a treaty giving them control of the planet.  Amidala flees the planet with her guardian Jedi and they have to repair their ship on Tatooine.  There they meet Anakin Skywalker.  Who just like Jesus was born to a virgin mother and may be &quot;the chosen one&quot; that will bring balance to the force.  Anakin is a slave and is freed after a long pod race in which he wins.  After this Anakin, the Queen, the Jedi, and our friend Jar Jar travel to Coruscant so they can pursuade the galactic Senate to intervene against the Trade Federation on their behalf.  Meanwhile Qui Gon Jin takes Anakin to the Jedi temple so Anakin can obtain permission to recieve Jedi training.  A very cranky Yoda says the boy is too old and dangerous to become a Jedi.  The very cranky Yoda orders Qui Gon to return to Naboo with the queen to protect her.  Back on Naboo a really big battle is fought and Qui Gon Jin dies and then Obi Wan kills a Sith Lord named Darth Maul.  Qui Gon has a funeral then there is a big celebration. The end.Okay, so the problems.  There is not an interesting character in this entire movie.  They are lifeless figures on screen whose dialog only serves to keep the plot moving along.  There is no real villian.  Darth Sidious spends the entire movie hiding in the shadows giving threats and Darth Maul only serves as a plot device to kill the Jedi.  His screen time is minimal and his character is hardly developed.  As a villian he has nothing on Darth Vader from the classic trilogy.  Another problem is Anakin.  I watched the documentary &quot;The Beginning&quot; and to be honest Jake Lloyd was the worst one who did a screen test.  I have no idea why they chose a kid who couldn't pronounce a lot of the words in the script.  Speaking of that documentary, Rick McCallum the producer serves as kind of a yes man to George Lucas.  His job is to tell the documentarian how great the movie is going to be.  I guess he gets paid a lot and his job would have been lost if he had been honest and said the story was terrible.  Then there were the Trade Federation guys.  Yeah, I know, a lot of you hate Jar Jar the most about this movie but he was not nearly as annoying as these Trade Federation guys.  They wear mask that look as if they were purchased in a dime store and talk in bad Asian accents.  When they guys are on screen I wonder if I am watching a Star Wars movie of the Power Rangers?  Okay, a lot of people think the saving grace of this movie is that Pod Race.  The Pod Race was modeled after that chariot race in a movie called Ben Hur.  But in Ben Hur there were real actors on real sets.  Not some kid in front of a blue screen.Just like Star Wars and Return of the Jedi, there is a battle station fight at the end in which our heroes most destroy the station.  And if you have no life like me you will have noticed that ROTJ ended with a funeral pyre, a celebration, and then end credits.  TPM also ends with a funeral pyre, a celebration, and end credits.

You have to watch a separate dvd extra to get the modifications--they aren't incorporated into the routine itself, which pretty much defeats the purpose.  You have to memorize the modifications and then remember them during the routine, which makes it harder to focus on the poses.  A second person doing the modifications during the routine itself would've made it much better, as the modifications are actually helpful and make uncomfortable poses more comfortable.  The routine itself is really basic and short--just 6 poses and it felt a little rushed (she says to hold poses for 5 deep breathes, and I barely got 2-3 deep breathes before she moved on).If you're a complete couch potato, this DVD would a good place to start.

1492281,"Boardwalk Empire had an interesting premise and some good historical material to mine. It worked ok for the first season. But as the second season went on, it became clear that the premise had been played out. The setting and the characters had been used up. And there was nowhere to go but down.The first major problem was that the show degenerated into ""Good Irish Wife Playhouse"". This is a gangster drama. Most people (including me) want to see gangster drama rather than the overblown domestic trials and tribulations of I dont know how many ""good"" Irish wives in the cast. And because its Good Irish Wife playhouse, we have to treat the death of her wifebeating, baby-killing drunken husband Hans as great crime. Somehow nobody makes the point that killing a guy who beats his pregnant wife up in they way he did can be seen more as a sort of rough justice rather than a moral crime. I'm not sure anyone even bothers to make the point about what sort of guy Hans was.About halfway through the season, they seemed to realize that the plot had run out. So they started killing and/or wrecking every character in the cast. By the end of the season, almost everyone but Thompson (and wife) was dead. Every episode seemed to require a shocking death or a shocking betrayal that often made little sense and were worse yet, against the actual history.The real Commodore lived to 1934. Yet in the show he is killed in the early 1920s to provide more mixed up family drama leading to the death of another character. The Commodore was an important character to the show because he provided the bridge between the political machine and the business community.The show also fails to understand the rules of a 1920s political machine. Gangsters were not going to openly kill high-profile businessmen or senior politicians without consequences. Especially a low-level gangster in Atlantic City. The show also doesn't understand that the local political machine fits into a bigger state-level machine with its own priorities.The show also ignores the democratic party in terms of how things got done in that era. The democratic party (who controlled the statehouse at the time) would have been leading the charge to get members of the atlantic city machine. And the democratic machine would have existed in parallel with the republican machine. Working with gangsters in New York or other east coast cities would require political negotiations as well as negotiations with gangsters. Disputes between gangsters turn into disputes between politicians. The writers just don't understand and don't care much about how the era really worked.By the end of the second season, everyone is dead and the show seems to have nowhere left to go. Its been renewed for a third season. But what that will consist of is unclear. They can either abandon history or they can repeat themselves.Steve Buscemi does an outstanding job in the lead role. He is the only person associated with this program who deserves awards. Its just a pity that the writers are not up to creating better material for him to play.",Boardwalk Empire: Season 2

916857,"Arizona Senator John McCain enjoys his present day life as an influential member of the congress, leading debates on important issues and influencing legislation. He often gets into conflicts over some of his stands, but none of these can compare to the conflict McCain experienced back in the late 1960's and early 1970's. It was during this time that McCain spent several years as a Vietnam prisoner of war. This event is the subject of this movie, which is based on McCain's book of the same name.In this film, McCain is portrayed briefly during his teenage years but the majority of the movie's time is spent either in Vietnam (inside the prison) or at McCain's military school, the U.S. Naval Academy. The movie begins by showing McCain (who is played by actor Shawn Hatosy) operating a fighter plane over Vietnam. He is shot down and has to parachute to safety; landing in water where some local Vietnamese come to his rescue and then promptly turn him over to the proper authorities. The film then alternates back and forth between scenes in the prison and flashbacks to scenes in the Naval Academy.There is some violence in this film, but it is nothing compared to what was actually experienced. And herein lies the main problem I have with this film. The director made this movie in a very toned- down fashion so that it would be mild enough to get past the censors and be shown on television. In order to accomplish this, he had to eliminate scenes of brutal violence; profanity; and tough talk. Because of this, the movie seems very unrealistic. If you have read McCain's book by the same name, then you know that the conditions and the treatment McCain and others like him endured were horrifying. None of this comes through in this movie. It comes across as a little rough and unpleasant, but nowhere near the awful, inhumane experience that it really was.Another problem I have with this film (which stems from the first problem) is the attitude of actor Shawn Hatosy and others who play the POW's. Hatosy's McCain character seems very bland, and rarely does he voice any concern over the nightmare he is living through. You can tell he and the others are not happy, but about the only dialogue you get is when McCain and another prisoner talk through the walls, between cells, by placing a cup to the wall. There is no intelligent dialogue, discussion of escape, feelings about the war or the captors, or anything else. This, again, makes the film seem a little unrealistic.This movie is 90 minutes in length and it needed to be another half hour (or more) longer to give the McCain story the attention and respect it deserves. McCain's story, as told in his book, would make for a great, dramatic, and powerful Hollywood motion picture about the atrocities of war. But the way it is presented in this film, his experience seems more like a bad day on the job than the horrifying experience that it really was.McCain, and the viewing public, deserved better.",Faith of My Fathers

385910,"According to most people I have spoken with, the 1984 George C. Scott version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL is most people's favorite.  I remember seeing it as a kid when it first aired on television.  I probably watched it a couple more times while growing up.  I saw it again about 5 years ago, and most recently, about a week ago.  Having read the book three or four times and watched numerous other performances, I have to say the George C. Scott's performance - though a worthy attempt - does not measure up to how Scrooge should be portrayed on screen.One point that this version did hit upon much better than any other verison I have ever seen was the role of Tiny Tim.  In this version, he actually looks (in the face) like a very sick child.  Other versions simply portray him as an otherwise healthy kid who for whatever reason gets around on a crutch (or on his father's shoulder).While it's true that every big and small screen version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL has taken it's own share of ""artistic liberties,"" the George C. Scott version not only follows the book pretty well in terms of story but gives the viewer an authentic glimpse of Victorian London in December as well as a peek into what was probably Ebenezer Scrooge's everyday life.  That aside, there is one or two glaring problems with this version.On one hand, although the morals in A CHRISTMAS CAROL are universal, one must remember that this is a very English story, and therefore Scrooge should either be played by an Englishman or at least by someone who can speak convincingly with an English accent.  Throughout most of this picture, George C. Scott does not seem to even put forth the effort to use an English accent.George C. Scott's Scrooge was a miser with a wry smile and an unattractive sense of humor.  While words like ""miser,"" ""wry,"" and ""unattractive"" are all fair descriptions of how Scrooge should be portrayed, the novel's description as well as that of most of the other film versions leave no place for any kind of a smile or sense of humor.George C. Scott looked like someone that it would have been easy to reform.  A proper portrayal of the unreformed Scrooge would show a man so disgusting in nature, so evil-looking that reform and redemption would seem impossible.  And the reformed Scrooge would look, at first glance, like a man who must have had some hard, terrible past.  (I think the Albert Finney version fulfills these two characteristics better than any other.)",A Christmas Carol VHS

Maybe it's because of all the clich&eacute;s, but this film just fell apart from the get go. There is no suspense, the acting is half-hearted, and that's not just because of the bad script. I actually couldn't even sit through the entire movie. So do yourself a favor, don't waste an hour and a half of your life on this movie. I didn't.",Kaw
523982,"Pitch Black brings to the screen the story of a spaceship carrying a wide variety of passengers that experiences technical problems while en route and is forced to crash land on a planet dominated by flying pterodactylus type monsters.The acting is very poor to the point that acting lessons are needed ASAP for everyone involved.The ""bad guy"" is much more like the usual pompous high school jock/""pretty boy"" seen over and over again in those types of movies.  Apart from his weak appearance he fails to convince in his role as a mean and greedy drug addicted mercenary.Furthermore, he somehow manages to kick Vin Diesel's butt repeatedly!!!Moreover, what was the point of the Muslim cleric with his four acolytes???Or the Australian woman and the arrogant Englishman for that matter?Not to mention the obnoxious, spoiled kid who for some reason is not scared at being stuck on ""hell planet"" and who has a ""surprise"" for us later on in the movie.Unless of course the whole point of having these annoying characters in the film was for the audience to enjoy seeing them picked off one by one in true B-movie fashion (as I've seen other reviewers characterize the movie).In a nutshell, it's an average plot, the acting and the actors are very weak, the dialogues are poor and the special effects are very good.The potential for a great movie was definitely there, but the surprisingly poor acting/casting and the full of holes plot prevented it from becoming anything more than average.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a B-movie so one should not expect too much.Overall, both Vin Diesel as well as the rest of the ""cast"" do a rather poor job of trying to cover up for the mediocre plot; wait `til Pitch Black is shown on TV.",N/A

805994,"In The Western Canon, Harold Bloom, probably the most influential - and some say greatest - critic, listed Angels in America (the play)as one of the important works. As a play, I see how it may work - great metaphorical, beautiful language and sometimes in iambic pentameter - very Shakespeare.But adapted to screen, I think it is the language that fails. It sounds contrived and unnatural. When Shakespeare's plays are transposed to films, the directors often find new ways, new settings, new mise-en-scene to match the metaphoric language but in the case of Angels in America (the series), the director does not and that's where it fails.Another thing that I do not understand is why Al Pacino is given the best actor in the Golden Globe over Douglas Kirk who plays a more central and convincing role. Marry-Louise Parker is undeserving of her best supporting actress Golden Globe award as she is most of the time, wooden at best.",Angels in America
725244,"A nice sunrise opening is never explained, but it would make a good postcard.  We are told that 'family photos are almost always of the happy moments and show smiling faces.'  We don't take pictures of something we want to forget.In the case of a fire, after pets, people usually save their family photos.  In the early '60s, I lived in an apartment building in the historic West Hill area of Pulaski, TN, where a fire started in the walls between the floors.  A neighbor sat down placidly to look at her photo albums, which I thought strange at the time.  I was busy getting my baby and cat and run down the stairs to deposit them on another neighbor's sofa.Sy has worked in a photo developing department of a store for 20 years and it is his life.  He gives special treatment to customers he likes, sometimes a free disposable camers as a birthday gift.He is a loner who ""adopts"" the Yorkin family.  Similarly, Miss Barnes, a spinster librarian at the college where we were, had considered me and mine as her surrogate family.  It is so sad when you have no one in your life, no one who really cares.He lives vicariously through the photos he personally handled (sometimes making a copy for himself) for nine years.  He tells the waitress at a seedy restaurant where he eats alone that the child is his nephew.  He collects all kinds of old photographs of people he doesn't know.  One was a Senior High picture of a girl taken in the '50s which he pretended was of his mother.His narration at intervals throughout the movie was most informative, such as, ""I was here; I existed.  Someone cared enough about me to take my picture.""In fact, he took one of himself at the end of one of the Yorkins' roll so they would see it.  He explained that a snapshot is a hurried shot taken without deliberate aim; a hunting term.  When I take photos, I always aim with an eye for a good background and sometimes abandon the shot if the background is not what I want.Sy gets a little too personal in his comments about their lovely home when he encounters the husband in the store one day.  A fantastic tree (such as the large one which grows outside my window) is shown at the Yorkin's front door.  He ""visits"" when they are not at home and makes himself 'at home' with a beer watching t.v. and even using the bathroom.  One day they catch him there and pretend he was expected.He observes a family coming apart emotionally with lots of interpersonal and financial problems, while Sy sits alone watching the Simpsons on t.v. and looking at his wall covered with snapshots of this young family.  He shadows the family wherever they go, even sits in the bar reading Deepak Chopra's THE PATHS TO LOVE as he knows that Ms. Yorkin is also reading this book.  He quotes a passage of Chopra's Eastern philosophy:  ""The things we fear the most have already happened to us.""From his voyeurism (looking through a set of intimate photos a young girl left to be developed), he discovers the adulterous behavior of Jake's father.  As a result, he inserts them into the envelope for some rather silly snaps the child took with his 'free' camera.He has made hundreds of copies of other photos without paying and, as a result, gets fired.  I liked the scene where he sits dejectedly on a bed in the store with a Kitty pillow.  Pathologically, he withdraws and his personality changes.  He sits in a corner on the floor and smiles at the atrocious assortment of snaps Jake took which Sy developed as his last 'job.'As he leaves on his final day of work, he steals a long butcher knife.  He follows as the Yorkins retrieved the photos to observe the wife's hurt and torment when she sees the evidence of her husband's infidelity.  He even goes so far as to hide and take pictures of the family through a large picture window as they go through the normality of a meal.  The purloined revealing, sexy photos didn't have the lasting effect he'd hoped for.He is clever in his demented state as he sets out to make things right for his beloved ""adopted"" family.  He tracks the philandering husband with his mistress to a hotel and maneuvers to get a room on the same floor.  He tortures the nude couple as he photographs them in sordid situations.He has committed a criminal act previously, by taking photos of his manager's young daughter.  Gary Cole was good as the manager who had to fire him.  He was marvelous in the t.v. series AMERICAN GOTHIC.  He has invated their existence and subsequently indirectly threatened the child's life.  The police are called and discover the wall of photographs which Sy has defaced by scratching the face of the husband in each one.He is able to delude them by intervening through a conference on 'retinal implants' at the hotel and escapes through the kitchen.  He runs like the athlete he never was, down the garage ramps.  But gets caught nevertheless.  He'd left the unused knife behind in room 519 and says, ""I just took pictures.""On the surface, Jake's dad looks the same but nothing will ever be the same.  Is this man smart enough to appreciate the good he has?  Or will he continue to cheat on his wife and neglect his son.  No one will ever be the same.Sy was harmed emotionallly by some of the content of photographs he'd developed for fifteen years.  Seeing some of the things people did to their children had left lasting damage to his psyche.  He ended up with stupid photos of inanimate objects that only a crazy person would take.  The scene where his nightmare showed blood gushing from his eyes had set him on a trail of depravity.Did this move have any redeeming quality?  I didn't see any, but this is one film it will take me a long time to forget.  Sorta like PSYCHO.  I guess that stands for something in the long run of things; perhaps a lesson was learned after all.",N/A

822544,"Patrick Swayze makes little more than a guest appearance in ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,"" the misbegotten ""sequel"" to the 1987 box office smash that turned the actor into a bona fide movie star.This time around the focus is on Katey Miller (Romola Garai), a high school senior who moves with her family to Cuba in 1958, right on the eve of the Castro revolution.  While there, she goes from being a white-bread, college-bound bookworm to a hot-blooded Latin dancer under the tutelage of a young Cuban (""Y Tu Mama Tambien""'s Diego Luna) who works poolside at the hotel where she and many other Americans live. Naturally, her cavorting around with a dark-skinned native raises a whole host of hackles among the snooty foreigners who live only to feed off the sweat and hard work of the indigenous population.Naturally, it is the dancing that is the key element in a film of this type, but even the choreography, which isn`t really all that impressive to begin with, can't overcome the film's humdrum storyline, shallow characterizations and infantile view of international politics.  The complexities of the Cuban revolution are glossed over in favor of soap opera mechanics and corny melodramatics.  As ""Doctor Zhivago"" proved long ago (only better), there's nothing like a governmental overthrow to put a little sizzle into your love life.As noted earlier, Swayze stops by briefly to reprise his role as Johnny Castle, providing Katie with a few words of wisdom and encouragement and showing her a few nifty dance moves before sending her on her way.  I hope Swayze was paid well for his efforts, but it seems a bit demeaning for a star of Swayze's caliber to be treated in so ungrateful and cavalier a fashion.  The irony is that the film would have been far more interesting had it focused on Castle instead of Katie, but it's obvious that the studio executives who green lighted this project weren't about to bankroll a dance film with a middle-aged actor in the lead role.  That ""Shall We Dance?"" will wind up doing far better at the box office than ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"" may provide some sweet vindication not only for Swayze but for all the fans of the original film for which this sequel was allegedly made.",Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights
391269,"Hilariously cornball, shamelessly manipulative, unforgivably hoary, indigestible remake of Alessandro Blasetti's 1942 Italian film ""Four Steps in the Clouds"" features enough stock characters and phony dialogue to overload a half-dozen more movies. WWII-era GI returns home to an indifferent wife; disillusioned, he hits the road to California by train, meeting a troubled, unmarried Italian miss on his journey. The train lurches suddenly and the two fall to the floor (in the missionary position!); she stands up and vomits on his uniform (cue to the audience: she's either got motion-sickness or she's pregnant...my guess would be the latter). He volunteers to temporarily pose as her husband once she returns to her hot-tempered Italian brood nestled deep in the valley on a Northern California vineyard estate (""It's called 'The Clouds'!""); naturally, leaving the forlorn beauty the next night proves to be difficult for the young soldier. ""Her father said the gringo would leave her,"" the grandpa tells him, ""And he will whip her with it!"" What exactly does this mean, and what kind of a father has this woman got, anyway? Keanu Reeves, blinking blankly with a slack expression, is such a terrible actor, he can't even look at the family spread and exclaim ""It's beautiful!"" without sounding insincere.

786999,"Perhaps one of the most interesting points of this DVD is the closing remarks where it is said that a lot of the information of this film could not be authenticated therefore it is left to viewer's discretion.  People are tired of character and reputation damaging ridicule, scorn, and of being dismissed as idiots and wanna-be fakers of allegedly trying to make possible for ourselves the big time benefits of fame, fortune, and being remembered for something unique and individual about ourselves.  Who is qualified to decide whether or not somebody deserves the positive reward they seek?  Community, family, social assemblies, academic pursuits, career environments, religious participation, private and/or public situations are all frontiers of human experience where each of us having subjected ourselves to them in one way or another, formulate anticipated return analysis so that we can be objective about our perspective and decide at what level we wish to continue submitting ourselves in that area of self-compromise.  Therefore, we tend to add disclaimers, loopholes, and escape clauses whenever we reduce our thoughts to writing so that our dreams don't end up replaced by regrets and so we are not incarcerated as those who need cleansed from society by permanent capital purging.  Nobody wants to commit themselves to culpability, responsibility, and/or expose themselves to the negative consequences of society's decision as to right or wrong these days; and given the ease of ability for research and the inherent reality that there is no end to ""experts"" on either side of any debate, many of us hesitate to offer any suggestion of any kind - to anybody.  Physically, spiritually, mentally, emotionally, financially, and esoterically, we all aspire to being given recognition, validation, significance, and to sense our own above average worth through tangible compensation of some type.  We all wish to be given (even if merely articulated) accolades of reward for performance, achievement, skills, experience, creativity, education, talent, motivation, integrity, honesty, ambition, and other arenas of excellence - real or imagined.  In fact, it is later in life many of us realize we will never be afforded opportunities, breaks, given a chance, or even have dumb luck let us fall into a position of fate providing us the better life and greater happiness that seems to elude us; unless we become convinced overwhelmingly that we can only achieve these vicariously.  It has been said that to find success you must have several connections and networks with people who WANT you to succeed, without which no amount of human effort can remove the foot of power off of the back of our neck.  Some people turn to chemical addiction, some to perversions and vice, and others turn to worship of some other thing or individual they consider higher than themselves - some other individual that has achieved what they themselves cannot (an example are extreme spectator level fans of professional sports, another example is the followings amassed by televangelists who bilk the multitudes out of life savings so that religious icon can live as though they were a peer to senators and congressional representatives who want us to believe they are public servants).  ""Out Of The Blue"" is a documentary for those of us who have come to realize we need something beyond above mentioned individually achieved independent routes for escape from our otherwise meaningless lives, and who look for that escape through any and all possible resources that lack legal consequences of the negative variety.  I doubt seriously if alien abduction would end up quite like most of us hope for, and unfortunately the genre of Sci-Fi fuels the nostalgic sentimentalization of what potential there is for wonderful and beautiful experiences beyond this earthly existence otherwise referred to as the ""rat race"" of working a thankless job and striving toward keeping your children out of prison or off of death row for being unable to adhere to irresistibly imposed requirements for social conduct and tolerance at the individual level (not found in larger society, groups, or committees).  If you believe that sitting in a chair for 40 years all by itself without further aggregate contribution gives you seniority rights of rank, privilege, and honor that negate any less senior peer regardless of the latter's education, performance, achievement, skills, experience, talent, motivation, honesty, creativity, ambition, integrity, honesty, or other allegedly superior characteristics, then you will criticize ""Out Of The Blue"" as being nothing but crap.  If you're not one of the cronies reaping benefits of being pandered to, then you might enjoy the potential this DVD suggests as frontiers for alternative human experience than what we've been exposed to so far.  If you are among those who fear a bit of metaphoric chlorine in the gene pool, then you won't be interested either.  ""Out Of The Blue"" held my attention for 2 hours and 35 minutes, and I would comment that they offer above average information on the subject of extraterrestrial life as being at least possible, especially since it is presented as being a documentary.  Released 2004, Hannover House studios, directed by James Fox, and narrated by Peter Coyote.  I like the presentation style, I like the sincerity of presentation, and I like how it doesn't keep repeating itself to fill up an allotted time requirement to justify being a documentary.  But there are more up-to-date films, photos, and interviews available.  I felt like this was presented by people who only consider the previous fifty or sixty years of information as viable, without regard to what has been happening in the last five years.  I was disappointed that all we got was whatever has been declassified due to the age of the information.  It is like waiting for the Vatican to release archeological discoveries that have information which challenges modern day thinking.  If I am to believe in UFO's and extra-terrestrial life, I don't want the history without the present.  Beam me up Scotty, or whoever that is standing at today's control console for the teleporter.",Out of the Blue - The Definitive Investigation of the UFO Phenomenon
970001,"Filmmaker Jon Braeley did a couple of things right with this one-hour documentary on Japanese Zen Buddhism.  He hired a skilledshakuhachi playerfor his soundtrack and as cameraman was able to take advantage of some wonderfully photogenic locations, including Sojiji, one of Soto Zen's main monastic training centers.It's too bad he didn't get a decent scriptwriter or a narrator able to pronounce Japanese.If you know absolutely nothing about zen, you might learn something from this film, though you're just as likely to get the wrong idea.  The film begins with titles superimposed over monks doing zazen:  ""Zen.  From the Sanskrit word, Dhyana.  From the Chinese word, Chan.""  In fact it's the other way round.  Zen is the Japanese word for Chan.  You might also get the idea that zen has a lot to do with home and garden design.  You surely won't come away understanding how zen is different from other forms of Buddhism.  In fact you might not even suspect it has anything at all to do with Buddhism.There's a lot of blather about one pointed concentration, freeing the mind, non-attachment, emptiness, becoming one with nature, living in the moment.  But these ideas are tossed into the pot without rhyme or reason, like someone making a stew with whatever they picked up out of the refrigerator.There is a short section on the technical details of doing zen (how to fold your legs, how to hold your hands, how to breathe), as well as demonstrations of formal, monastic style zen.  But I really doubt anyone new to zen would be able to do much on their own with the material presented here.The best parts of the films are interviews with zen roshis from both the Rinzai and Soto traditions. Unlike the narrated script, which is full of the platitudes you might find in an episode of Kung Fu, these gentlemen are quite practical and down-to-earth.  The Godo Roshi at Sojiji (whose name is mistransliterated as Dai Tow) explains that satori, or enlightenment, is not a special power or state of being.  It is simply becoming yourself.  There is, he explains (contrary to the narration), no such thing as a mind without thought, that as long is there is mind there is thought, there are sense impressions.  This is the nature of mind.  The important thing, he stresses, is to accept what is, without fear and without favor.Unfortunately, the interviews with the monks and roshis account for less than one quarter of this film's 60 minutes.  Anyone seriously interested in zen would do well to skip this film and instead find agood book, or visit a nearby temple or zen center.(Note that most of the 5-star reviews are from people with only one or two other reviews, most often other products from people who worked on this film.  Looks like promotion from friends and relatives.)#",The Zen Mind

1651825,"I'm getting tired of reviewing animated children's films and saying ""it's not Pixar"" -- and it's growing irrelevant, as Pixar's last two outings were disappointing.  Nonetheless, that run from Toy Story in '95 to Toy Story 3 in 2010 -- 15 years, 11 classic animated films with a nary a dud in the bunch -- set the bar so high it's impossible NOT to compare everything else to those films. ""Epic"" wants to be classic and grand, strives to be on a level with Pixar, but falls short.  What's interesting is where it falls short. It pretty much nails the epic scenes, the big action pieces. They are exciting and graceful, sometimes approaching breathless. And it looks great, no doubt about that. But ""Epic"" crumbles badly in the in-between scenes, the ones that make the action matter.  The subtle gestures, the ticks of personality, aren't there.  The characters feel thin, like cardboard cutouts or on loan from a stock animation company.  We have the gruff protector who struggles to express his love for anybody or anything.  The reckless but talented young buck who butts heads with him, but does the right thing when the chips are down. The Abbott and Costello sidekicks (a slug and a snail.) The wise man who doesn't know half as much as he pretends to and is kind of a slob, but once again, gets it done when everything's on the line.But the worst of the bunch is the villain.  Christoph Waltz voices the character, and that ought to be a casting jackpot - Waltz was one of the most chilling villains of recent years in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" (as well as an equally chilling good guy in last year's ""Django Unchained"") but the writers and directors of ""Epic"" have no idea what to do with him.  Frankly, I'm not sure Christoph Waltz is anything special outside of Tarantino's writing and pacing.  He excels gloriously in those slow, tortuously suspenseful, dialogue-heavy scenes that nobody but Tarantino seem to get right.Actually, I felt a bit sorry for the bad guy, whose name is Mandrake.  He's the ruler of a kingdom of rot and decay, diametrically opposed to the kingdom of life and growth ruled by Queen Tara and her Leaf Men.  Tara is voiced by Beyonc&eacute;, who, with her distinctive urban/ ghetto accent, seems like a weird choice for Queen of the Forest, but whatever.  Early in the action, Mandrake's oafish son is killed by a Leaf Man, and apparently reproduction is extremely difficult for tiny creatures of the forest, because Queen Tara has one chance in a hundred years to produce an heir, by picking a water-lily pod and making sure it blooms in the moonlight.  So Mandrake decides to steal the pod, make sure it blooms in the dark, and thus claim the progeny as his own.  So basically, the bad guy is just looking to replace his dead son. That's not so terribly evil and villainous, is it?The first half hour is annoying and laborious first dominated by clunky exposition and a terrible performance from Jason Sudeikis as the only big person who believes that Leaf Men exist.  He is clumsy and dorky and hare-brained; basically Rick Moranis from ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" minus any of the charisma and cuteness Moranis brought to that role.  But once all the exposition, and all the big people, are out of the way, ""Epic"" picks up steam and moves from painful to pleasing.  That's because the characters stop talking and start swooping around on hummingbirds and stuff.  It looks good, it moves great, but it somehow lacks that sense of enchantment that it so desperately needs to really succeed.  At one point (during the laborious first half hour) I found myself wishing they had just made little action figures, with their leaf outfits and saddled birds, and let the kids loose in the forest with them.  A couple of 7 year olds could come up with a fresher, more exciting and intriguing story than the one on the screen.I'm not sure the plot even makes sense -- the more I try to write about it, the less I find I understand. To put it briefly, Seyfried gets shrunk down to leaf man size, the queen dies, the pod gets stolen, and a motley crew of adventurers set off on an epic quest to save the forest.  Life lessons are learned, young folks fall in love, relationships are restored, and long-hidden emotions are finally expressed.There's just way too much going on here, leaving us little time to enjoy or explore the tiny world of the leaf men and their adversaries, or to feel like we know and care about the characters.  Watching it, I got the feeling that the producers and animators spent the majority of their time and resources on the action scenes, and then hurriedly wrote and drew the scenes in between them. That's not the way you tell an epic story.  That's the way you make a big, busy, beautiful but ultimately heartless and empty summer blockbuster.  To put it succintly, ""Epic"" isn't.If you're all excited about seeing an animated flick about tiny people, let me recommend a much better movie - last year's overlooked and underrated ""The Secret World of Arrietty,"" from Studio Ghibli, creators of kids' classics like ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Spirited Away."" ""Arrietty's"" not quite up to that level, but it's a much more carefully crafted tale, and captures the wonder and magic of being six inches tall in a world made for much bigger folks.[...]",N/A

1380270,"A few years ago, Telemundo had a pretty good telenovela about Zorro.  It had too much telenovela silliness and not enough Zorro, but it got me interested in the genre.  I vaguely remembered seeing some scenes from this Zorro back in the 90's, but I had never watched it.  After the Telemundo Zorro, I wanted to try it out and the reviews here on Amazon were so good, I was very excited to get it (plus Amazon had it on a good sale for a weekend).To be honest, so far I have only made it through the first DVD of the first season, but it has been quite painful.  This is SOOO bad.  It's almost on the level of the original Batman (except Batman knew it was silly).  There is no real drama, but to be fair it's hard to get real deep in a half hour show, especially when you have to have at least one sword fight plus a feel good ending where they all sit around laughing at the goofy sergeant.  Not only is it family friendly, it seems written for, if not by, 12 year olds.  The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters are one dimensional, the plots are silly and predictable, and the theme song is terrible (To compare, listen to/watch the theme song from the Telemundo version, Amor Gitano by Beyonce and Alejandro Fernandez).  (By the way, I just watched the episode where a fake Zorro burns down a Native American village.  I'm certainly not sure, but did the Native Americans in California use tipis?)Is this going to get better?

There are some good elements lost in the mess, but they're crushed under layer upon layer of other stuff, that was seemingly added by an endless parade of Hollywood executives.Zorro is still a great, enduring icon, probably today moreso than ever. But when the filmmakers make a Zorro movie that isn't about a charismatic swashbuckler, but instead seems to center on explosions, a weird proto-socialism and divorce (in 19th century California, no less), you know the heart of the film has gotten lost.

He meets a woman (Natasha Henstrige), and falls for her, but she is not very interested in having a love affair right now -- at least with him. And this is the way the movies goes... Nothing new or exciting -- apart from the dogs that could have had a much bigger part in this misguided flick.They are the stars and steal any scene they are in (Not that would have been a very difficult task due to the cast they acted with, but anyway they do steal). The pets are treatead as it they were a kid, so they go to 'school', go to a shrink and family sessions... and get graduated. But the human beings also wanted to have a part in the story and this is when the movie becomes a whole mess.Luke Wilson plays his usual role: the nice, a bit silly and single guy. Natasha Henstrige tries hard but can't avoid her femme fatale look. She palys a Mrs booksworm in a TV show, but she does not look like the kind of girl we expect to be reading for our children. Plus, they have no chermistry together, you don't give a damn if they'll get married or kill each other.Many directors have tried to copycat Altman, putting some characters together in a web that is revealed little by little. Some have succed, but many have failed. This film belongs to the second option. If this strategy is not well done, it looks like the characters of the movie are the only human beings on earth, and not that casuallity put them together.To sum up, if you really really really like dogs, watch this film but fastfoward the scenes which they are not in.

The opening scene has a friend encouraging her to buy an obviously expensive home in New York city - because ""he can afford it"". And we also learn it is her intention to go back to Columbia University. One assumes her ex will be responsible for the bills or she has been given a handsome settlement that enables her to continue with her life of trivial pursuits.Enter the men. Three thieves. All, naturally of course, lacking enough collective cerebral power to exit the house on finding it is occupied and coming back at another time. The only motivation to staying is possibly that they were aware of the mother's vocation as a silver spoon divorcee and knew that her schedule between tennis lessons, random weekends in the country, classes and cappuccino would be unpredictable. So why not stay and see how it goes? Duh?Well predictably it doesn't go well. Motivated by the impoverishing divorce where she can now only access millions of dollars instead of tens or hundreds of millions and protecting her chronically wounded daughter, the mother puts up a mythic defense against the sullying patrimony of society.

1201883,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***All romantic movies chronicle the progress of a romantic relationship as it (usually) triumphs over many small obstacles, or one major obstacle. In romantic fantasy movies, the obstacle or obstacles are supernatural. However, regardless of the nature of the obstacle, a romantic movie will succeed in moving us only if the couple portrayed is multifaceted, complex, sympathetic, sensible, and endearing. If the couple is not, they are in danger in being upstaged by the obstacle or obstacles opposing their union. In my opinion, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" suffers from the latter condition.""The Time Traveler's Wife"" chronicles the tortured progress of the romantic relationship between Chicago librarian Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) and heiress/aspiring artist Clare (Rachel McAdams). The obstacle that dogs them before and after their marriage is a diabolically tragic doozy: Henry is genetically predisposed to time travel randomly and unwillingly throughout his life (called chrono-displacement in the movie) whenever he is stressed, drunk, or emotionally distraught. Even worse, he must do so stark naked (a la the Terminator) because his clothing is not organic and therefore must find clothes in the time period he lands in (past, present, and even future) before he suffers social embarrassment, arrest for indecent exposure, or sickness like hypothermia. As I said, it's a doozy of a problem, and it detracts from Henry and Clare's relationship, sweet and gentle as it is.Of course, the time travel angle dredges up all the usual paradoxes (e.g. you can't change the past, alternate time-lines, past/present/future versions of yourself). But the movie complicates the paradox even further by having nearly infinite versions of Henry (from five-year old child to middle-age adult) flitting back and forth through time. Sometimes, implausibly, these different versions meet each other (wouldn't they explode on contact, like matter/anti-matter). Furthermore, Henry's appearances and disappearances are unpredictable. Not only does Clare not know when Henry will return from his bare romps, she doesn't even know which Henry will return. But she has the patience of Penelope waiting for Odysseus, and she treats Henry's condition mostly as an inconvenience.Clare's cavalier attitude towards Henry's condition is stupefying, even for a romantic fantasy. Doesn't she realize Henry is subject to a tragic curse? Why haven't the couple tried to find a cure earlier on in the relationship? Why didn't Henry and his father, who knows his son has the condition, try to cure him when he was a boy or a teenager? Life must have been hell growing up. Still, Henry amazingly appears to be a fundamentally well-adjusted and stable person. One would think his condition would have eroded his sanity and made him suicidal.Some posters advise to treat the time-travel angle as a plot device and just enjoy the budding romance and marriage. I couldn't. Without the suspense of knowing when and where Henry would vanish, the romance is actually pretty vapid and pedestrian. Henry and Clare certainly make an attractive, sexy couple, but they seem to be boring, ordinary people leading boring, ordinary lives. Even their creepily precocious daughter Alba is interesting only because she has inherited her father's time-traveling ability and can even control it to some extent. More detrimentally, Clare at times comes across as a slightly whiny, precious princess a bit too focused on her own needs. For example, she gets upset at Henry when he reappears after having missed Christmas and New Years. Honey, the dude can't help it. At that point, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"" should have been playing on the soundtrack. Also, she wants a baby so desperately that even though one version of Henry (""the"" version, I guess) gets a vasectomy to avoid having a child who will suffer his curse, she ""cheats"" on that version with a younger, ""fully functional"" version of Henry and conceives Alba in a car in a Chicago parking lot.Not even death can really bring poor Henry release; toward the end of the movie, Henry reappears naked in the meadow where he first met his future bride when she was six. This time, however, it's winter and Clare's boorish hunter father mistakes him for a deer and kills him. No matter, there will always be another version of Henry (young or old) to visit and comfort Clare. So immortal love conquers all! Does it makes your eyes tear up? Oh, please, it made my eyes roll!If you want to see a better constructed and involving romantic fantasy involving the undeniably handsome and magnetic Eric Bana, I'd suggest watching Ang Lee's Hulk. His relationship with Jennifer Connelly's character is more intricate, plangent, and affecting. Besides, he gets to keep his pants on (most of the time) even after he transforms into the Hulk.P.S:  I theorize that Henry's chrono-displacement genes must be recessive, because neither of his parents could time travel.  Therefore, both parents must have been chrono-displacement gene carriers and gave their recessive genes to Henry when he was born.2.5 stars out of 5",N/A

1023547,"What else can you say about a franchise ""restart"" that feels, plays, and ends like a drawn out coda instead of a jubilant new beginning.  Helmer Brian Singer is handed the keys to the character that can do anything, along with 60+ years of stories to draw from, but what does he do with it?  An Oxygen network movie of the week, with almost perfunctory nods to what the character is really about.  Singer attempts to pull drama and tension from the romance of the 80's movies, but since the actual parting between the leads is never adequately explained, there is no real tension in it, nor any real drama to be had in its resolution, only the ill-defined squirming sensation that relationship sitcoms get in season 2.This genre and this character each have clich&eacute;s of their own.  Those clich&eacute;s are fundamental to making the character who he needs to be, and the stories true to that character.  The question has to be: Why do a Superman movie if you don't really want to tell a Superman story?  I am at a total loss for some the new direction taken by this movie.  A new character is introduced that has nothing to do with the established mythos, a character that will gobble plot space in any subsequent in-continuity stories.  Without giving anything away, imagine if you went into a Bond movie, and they had replaced ""M"" with a pair of CGI wisecracking dogs voiced by Robin Williams and Larry the cable guy.  It might be funny, and it might make a few bucks, but it wouldn't be a Bond movie anymore.  That's what we have here:  a story line that drifts cheaply and unnecessarily so far away from the source that it's no longer Superman.Routh and Spacey do serviceable jobs, respecting and building on the previous actors' styles while adding the touches needed for the new project, but Kate Bosworth is a total disaster.  Staggering from scene to scene with a freshly tasered junior high vibe that conveys nothing of what her character is supposed to be.  Lane, the reporter, is 30-ish, sharp, refined, sexy, accomplished, and world weary but still energetic and positive.  Bosworth comes across as 19, slow, dull, suburban, mousey, coddled, and resigned.  (Better casting would have been to put the underutilized Parker Posey in this role, but she's wasted providing paint-by-numbers comic relief.)Even the iconic outfit, a 100% no-brainer, is just wrong.  The color scheme was so bad that I had originally thought it was deliberate disinformation to throw off merchandise counterfeiters.  No such luck.  Baby blue and dark brick red:  The man of steel rendered as your grandma's basement laundry room.Off the reservation on the major plot points, tone deaf on the female lead, wrong on some obvious details, and silent on the continuity problems.  Just two or three action pieces, and a final climax that never climbs above ""OK, I pushed hard once, but now I'm REALLY pushing hard"".Worth a watch just to say you've seen it, but it's a let-down to anyone expecting a Superman movie to tell a Superman story.",N/A

501139,"The reason I bought this film, is because I like Talia Shire. The only reason to buy this film is because of Shire, cause if you don't like Shire then I wouldn't recommend you buying this film.The Landlady follows the frustrated Melanie, a woman who's husband cheats on her, a situation that lets something snip in her mind. She becomes obsessed with having the perfect family and husband. After she kills her husband, she moves into an appartmentbuilding which she inherrited. There she meets Patrick who becomes her new object of desire to start a new family with. And she lets nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody come in her way...In technical aspects, the Landlady is ok, not fantastic, but ok. It has good camera movements (some could have been way better to make it more tense) and the lighting is well done which gives some scenes a nice horror feel. The music also is nice in some scenes.Now the acting could have been way better, not counting Talia Shire. Shire is the one who keeps the film away from the pit of the terribly bad films. But although she acts good, in some scenes you really feel that she doesn't give her 100% which is a pitty: she could have done way better than this. But one thing she does perfectly: even though she is the bad one in the film and kills a lot of people, she actually makes you feel for the pshyco landlady. That is what makes her performance ok.Now the rest of the cast acts so emotionalless that you absolutely don't care that they are getting killed. The only one I did care for was a character played by Dee Freeman, she does an ok actingjob also. But as for the rest: they don't feel like people but just minor props that have to be taken care of. You will find yourself looking at the screen saying: ""Oh, there goes another one.""Conclusion: The murders look more funny than they look scary or emotional.Also the tempo of the film is sometimes awfully slow. It takes a long time from one murder to another which will dissapoint slasher and horror fans.So when you sit down and watch the Landlady, watch it with your sense of humor switched on, then it will be more watchable then when you watch it counting on a scary horrorfilm.So if you are a Talia Shire fan, I would recommend you this film cause it is fun to see Shire do something totally different than playing a lovely sweet innocent woman. If you are not a Shire fan, then this film will look like just another low budget, wanna-be horror film to you.",N/A

For the majority of the few fight scenes that do happen, there is use of wires and CG.  The reason Ong Bak 1 and 2 were so good is because they didn't include that crap.  There is one fight involving the Crow character from the end of Ong Bak 2 vs. a bunch of lackeys, and the wire jumps and CG make it plodding and unimmersive.It also seems like the director was trying too hard to be ""cinematic"".  Many parts of the movie just feel cheesy, and it is extremely apparent you are watching a movie.  When watching Ong-Bak 1 & 2, I felt like I was witnessing a story, not watching a movie.  I got absorbed into Ong Bak 1 & 2, but not 3.Overall, the fight scenes feel very weak.  The first fight scene is conceptually cool (I won't say much about it in case you do watch the film), and the second to last fight is the only real stellar fight.  That scene is Tony Jaa in his element:  No wires or CG, restrained & non-intrusive use of slow-mo, and furious combat against many foes.

Busey is good as a murdering psychopath who may or may not be Rutger Hauer's character from the original film, but Howell looks so bored in his brief return as Jim, and Wuhrer's acting abilities are wasted leaving her as eye candy (which isn't such a bad thing).  The police force is presented here as ignorant hillbillies, a stereotype which the original Hitcher avoided, and the acting isn't anything to write home about either.  Predictable until it's end, which actually does offer a few nice surprises, the Hitcher 2 is something which should have never been.

They approach the city then instead of seeing any destruction the audience is shown a satellite image and the government officials say Reno is being devastated. The tease was like a punch in the gut. I then figured maybe the scenes of destruction would be saved for the climax. Nope. The tendrils reach Sacramento, the image shakes a bit while people run, then that's it.The movie was shot well.

470085,"Considering the number of 5 star reviews here, and the standard throwaway &quot;Best movie I've ever seen in my life! &quot; outbursts, I know not to rent a movie based on most of the stuff written here. In fairness, I'm  sure alot the reviews here were written by teens, and I might have liked  Never Been Kissed if I was a teen myself. But I'm in my late 20's now and  seeing the same old teen cliches is tiresome. The dialogue in this movie  was clunky, with rarely a funny sentence spoken by any of the characters.  I've always liked Drew Barrymore, her sweetness comes across as genuine,  and she was pretty likeable in this movie and fun to watch as well. But the  intended message in this movie was this, if you're born ugly you're not  worth a damn because did you notice how better-looking Drew became as the  movie progressed? This coincided with her growing popularity with the other  students. In real life, Drew isn't ugly, and neither was her outcasted  &quot;geeky&quot; friend who was supposed to be unattractive as well. Other  cliches: the young good-looking heartthrob teacher, the dumb jock, the  three inseperable shallow bimbos who get what they deserve in the end  (shocking), aren't these same three girls in every teen movie? The black  guy with nothing but bad one-liners, and of course the embarrasing final  scene where the &quot;positive message&quot; speech which is spooned down  your throat like barium before a stomach x-ray.

427607,"Demetrios is a Cad and a Nogoodnik.  The movie is all over the place telling the recollections of people who had various cadly dealings with Demetrios.  There is no plotline.  The anecdotes are 5 - 10 minutes in length and involve many different unrelated characters from eastern Europe mostly.  There is no action as such.  It reminded me a lot of what we know today as a television soap opera.  I like Greenstreet and Lorre very much.  They seem relaxed and comfortable in the movie.  There was entirely too much cigarette smoking for my taste.  The movie is interesting to me mainly because it is a time capsule of a simpler better art deco era,  when there were no computers and televisions, and darn few radios, and landline telephones were the height of modernity and innovation.  Railroad train travel was the height of fashion and convenience.  I could watch B & W movies like this one all day, except I would need kegs of popcorn and I can't take the calories any more.***A better movie where Greenstreet and Lorre have bigger and much more elegant parts is ""The Verdict"" with a linear and well dramatized plot ... still noir but much better directed***",The Mask of Dimitrios VHS

Of course it's so confusing knowing which one is which that I honestly had more trouble just following along to the plot than anything else.In addition to that, the woman who plays lead characters spends WAY too much time screaming her head off and never acting normal even for a *second* so the entire film ended up giving me a headache.I understand she'd freak out during one scene involving her daughter by a lake, but for the most part, she was extremely hard to deal with thanks entirely to her nonstop screaming.  It was completely out of control to an annoying extent.Sometimes I just don't get what the writers are going for, and this *extremely* confusing storyline is a perfect example of ""I don't get it"" that I've ever seen.  You just don't know what's going on half the time... no no, make that 25% of the time.  It's all a big bundle of confusion and it never really stops being confusing either.The acting (other than the screaming woman playing lead role) is pretty decent though.

282702,"&#34;Motel Hell&#34; is quite a difficult film to gauge. It is referred to as a horror-comedy, but that description isn't very accurate, as it is more weird than funny and more macabre than scary.The story revolves around a couple of hoteliers (played by Rory Calhoun and Nancy Parsons), who have a side business selling fine smoked meats. But what makes the meats so good is the terrifying secret ingredient of human flesh.I have to say, going into this film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. With cannibalism being a factor in the film, you might be expecting a lot of gruesome scenes. Yet, surprisingly, there is very little in the way of graphic gore to be found. The story is also a bit odd, in that there are some scenes that seem to drag on, yet give you little in the way of a pay-off. Also, most of the acting is fairly poor. Whether this is due to the lack of skills of the actors, or a case of a script that gives them little to work with, I can't really say. The side drama about the love triangle involving Terry (played by Nina Axelrod) and the brother of the cannibal farmer, who is also the town's Sheriff (played by Paul Linke), is little more than a strained (and sometimes dull) attempt to set up the final conflict between the brothers. Although, the film can boast of being an early work for actor John Ratzenberger (who would go onto heights of television fame on the series &#34;Cheers&#34;). Unfortunately, he gets very little to do in the film (including not a single piece of dialog) being nothing more than a victim to be killed. Director Kevin Connor never really seems to bring the story to life, until towards the very end. And if you haven't found yourself engaged long before that point, it probably won't much matter to you. The cinematography is fine, but it feels like it would play better on an old drive-in screen, than on your television, which is probably only fitting, as the film was obviously geared for such a venue.The only things that save this film from the scrap pile, are the last 20 minutes of the film and the solid performance of Rory Calhoun as the cannibalistic farmer. He manages to make you believe both his down-home country manners and his twisted psychotic reasoning in killing people for food. His performance stands high above anyone else in the film. And the final battle at the film's end also brings a spark of life to what, up until this point, has been a very strange and slow-moving tale. When Calhoun's character comes out wearing a pig's head and wielding a chainsaw, it is truly a sight to behold.As I said at the start, &#34;Motel Hell&#34; is a hard film to figure out. It's not really good and looks extremely dated today, but neither is it total crap and completely uninteresting. Die-hard horror buffs might want to check this one out, but I highly doubt many others would have much interest in this cult film. It really is an enigma in the world of horror cinema.",Motel Hell VHS
1325225,"I can sum up what's wrong with this work very easily: it's the kind of film where characters do, say, and feel things because the script says they do. The most egregious example of this is the romantic sub-plot between Thor and Jane Foster. It's just sort of plopped in our laps that these two characters who've only just met are now madly in love.Are they? Well gee. How about that, huh?There are also problems with the visual design of the film. I'm particularly thinking here of the sets and costuming. To be fair, they started out with the right idea, taking their cues directly from Jack Kirby's original work on the Marvel comic book version of Thor. But while the idea may have been great, the execution was profoundly uninspired. Just as any mediocre art student can ""copy"" van Gogh's style up to a point, these people have copied Kirby... up to a point. But that spark of something exceptional that allowed Kirby to truly add to the visual language of our culture - it's just not there. The electrifying energy and well-nigh cosmic sense of portent that were such hallmarks of Kirby's work are nowhere to be found. In this film Loki's helm looks like exactly what it is: a chunk of plastic.In the end, I'd have to say that what's really wrong with the film is the same thing that's wrong with most superhero films: even though they hired a bunch of A-listers to pull it off, having been hired these people did not apparently see any real need to take what they were doing especially seriously. It's not that they produced a campy farce. It's more that they very obviously didn't feel the need to bring their own A-games to bear. After all, it's only a superhero movie. A summer blockbuster. `Nuff said.To be fair, for the most part the fault lies not so much with the actors as with the writers and director (although in exception to this, I'm not entirely sure that Anthony Hopkins was even awake for much of the filming). But getting back to those behind the camera, it's quite plain for all to see that these people just didn't care that much about what they were doing.As a result, just...Meh.Theo.",N/A

845610,"Grande Ecole (Robert Salis, 2004)Salis (Living Naked)'s first non-documentary feature is an adaptation of a Jean-Marie Besset play which, I confess, I have neither read nor seen. So take this review with a grain of salt; most of the aspersions I'm going to cast here may have less to do with Salis than with Besset.The plot: Paul (Gregori Baquet) and Agnes (Alice Taglioni) are dating. Agnes wants to move in together; Paul would prefer to live on campus with roommates. It quickly becomes obvious that Paul would, specifically, rather live with Louis-Arnault (Jocelyn Quivrin, recently of Syriana). Despite Louis-Arnault having a girlfriend himself, Agnes makes Paul a bet-- whichever of the two seduces Louis-Arnault first can have him. To add onto the complexity, Paul also finds himself drawn to a university worker, Mecir (Selim Kechiouche), who's more open about returning Paul's affections than is Louis-Arnault.There's a whole lot going on here, and Salis wants to pack it all into this film. That's all well and good; the many subtexts here are well worth exploring. Unfortunately, what suffers is the main story itself; what could well have been a sumptuous erotic buffet ends up neither sumptuous nor erotic. The obvious crux of the whole thing is Paul's confusion, but there's never a point where Paul (or Baquet; hard to tell whether the fault is with character or actor) seems at all confused. Which might be excusable if we had any indication that he was manipulating everyone else-- but, of course, we don't get that, either. We've really no idea what Paul is doing here, other than wandering through the movie, barely reacting to the events around him. The rest of the characters are scarcely better; Agnes manages to work up a head of steam every once in a while, but seems to be suffering from sleeping sickness most of the time. Louis-Arnault's hapless girlfriend Emeline has an excuse, at least, as everyone involved is keeping her in the dark, and Louis-Arnault himself manages to show some emotion now and again. Louis-Arnault, in fact, quickly becomes the movie's most intriguing character; one can never be sure whether he's oblivious or leading Paul on, and unlike the rest of the cast, Quivrin pulls the role off with flair. Unfortunately, the longer the movie goes on, the less important Louis-Arnault is to it.I wanted to like this movie. I really did. The best of intentions, however, sometimes can't produce results. So it was with both Grande Ecole and my reaction to it. **",N/A

1100681,"When Nietzsche Wept is a fun little movie, but not much more. The academic mind may gather interesting tidbits of allusive material, anecdotes that qualify in flesh a mode and a period, but little else in terms of insight or theoretical enlightenment. It is unfair to ask of so much from a movie, but there have been gems which have accomplished much more without pretending half as much, which is the main reason for my two stars. There are dream sequences that skirt the parodic while insinuating to be reminiscent strains of a therapeutic groundwork, but these are really a far cry from being of any import to anything but excessively  reductive commonplace assumptions popo culture has already adopted grand scale. The passion of Nietzsche is depicted with emotional farce, but the actor here cannot do justice to the gentle genius that trumpeted the death of God, a death knell poeticized and antagonized by a secularism in disguise and denial. Whatever the merits of Nietzsche may have been, the shortcomings the movie's depiction of Viennese physician Dr. Josef Breuer are extensive and irresponsible, if one wishes to here locate historical accurancy rather than artistic liberty. Infact Dr. Breuer is a man so comical and absurd here we end up pitying a mind who should command reverence and applause. I do not know why this motion picture ends up ridiculing, even mocking a man who has had so much influence on contemporary culture. It is really disturbing to see a legacy so belittled and denigrated. Perhaps I am being too rough on the script, and I must also here note that I have not read the novel by Irvin D. Yalom, who also has written a cute paraphrase on Shopenhauer.Any vigor that may result from a revival of women who have influenced the course of history, yet had no claim in our paternalistic, phallocentric historical narrative, are debunked by its crass infusion of hysteria ironically presented without enough sensibility or attention to Bertha, who needless to say, deserves better treatment. Lou Salome is perhaps a positive presence in the movie, but she is also rendered without a modicum of wit or grace, and only her strength of character and presence of mind are evoked somewhat satisfactorily. Finaly the young Freud is but an aside and we are never offered an opportunity to understand his musings on the ""talking cure"" even slantwise.Finally the filmography, the editing and the presentation of the philosophy of Nietzsche are so reductive one comes out of this viewing hoping these fools had better sense than its director.It doesn't make you think and it doesn't make you question. Does it entertain? That depends on your taste, but if you enjoy zany productions you may come out of this with a laugh or two, otherwise any Hollywood movie has more to offer.",When Nietzsche Wept

1621220,"This bloodsucker comes from schlock-horror filmmaker Dario Argento. Rather than recreate some new basis for a Dracula film, Argento takes bits and pieces of Stoker's characters and just puts them in a new setting. Gone is the gothic castle in Transylvania and the long ocean voyage to England. Instead Dracula (a wooden Thomas Kretschmann) has a pretty decent updated castle in some little village in the Carpathians. The time is still the 1870's as near as I could determine but Lucy (Asia Argento) lives with her father, the village mayor. Harker (Unax Ugalde) comes from a nearby city to work for Drac as his librarian rather than being a real estate broker.Evidently Dracula has some little arrangement with the village council (excluding the mayor) where nobody asks questions in return for what, not being a victim? Right off the bat (pun intended), we see the comely Tanja (Miriam Giovanelli) become the first victim. Not until after she does a little soft porn shuffle with a married man in a haystack. As she walks back home alone...at night...in the woods, you know what to expect. Yep she's attacked by the vampire disguised as...an owl! Yeah, Dracula is bored with bats and wolves and mist and likes to morph into flies, rats and get this, a giant bright green praying mantis. What have I gotten myself into here?Mina (Marta Gastini), of course is Drac's ultimate objective as she is the spittin' image of his long departed original lover. Mina comes to the village from the nearby city looking for her husband, Harker who hasn't kept in touch. Rutger Hauer shows up 72 minutes into the 110 minute movie as Prof. Van Helsing and immediately goes to work dispatching people getting in his way.I've never quite appreciated Argento's work and frankly get a little squirmy thinking about him directing his daughter's nude sex scenes. I refuse to fully dismiss the film, however bad it is (very). I thought the musical score wasn't too bad. Kind of a throwback to the 60's. At least it added to the non-existent tension. The sets were fine - no scratch that - terrible. The 3-Dness was acceptable and not a distraction. But even the nudity isn't a big draw. The script is terrible and the acting is just horrible. Yeah, it's all pretty bad.The 3-D Blu ray is fairly cheap to buy (Best Buy) and isn't a bad transfer either. I only watched the 3-D but did watch just a bit of 2-D for comparison. The 3-D doesn't add a lot but the colors are fine. The contrast and detail are excellent as well. As with all 3-D, the picture looks a bit darker, but I didn't find that a big problem. Perhaps because the lighting was consistently boring in the film. The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and an optional LPCM 2.0. The cast is comprised of mostly Italian actors and it was evident most were dubbed in with English or American accents. Some of the dubbing looked and sounded just fine. Others just not. The audio is actually very good with plenty going on in the surrounds. There are Spanish and English SDH options. Extras include a 1 hour + ""Behind the Scenes,"" a music video, and a couple trailers.",Dracula Di Dario Argento

778373,"&quot;Born to Be Bad&quot; is a very uncharacteristic Cary Grant movie. Uncharacteristic because it's at the beginning of his career, features him in an almost non-comedic role and has him cast as a man double-crossed by a woman of easy virtue in an almost maudelin plot. The story concerns Grant hitting the son of a woman of easy virtue (Loretta Young) with his car. He then having to make the mends. The rest is pure melodrama but pulled off with such panache that you'd scarcely mind any of the hockum. Truly, this is a very, very good movie.TRANSFER: Unfortunately the same can't be said for FOX's transfer. We get a very dirty, very gritty, very grainy transfer that - although free of digital anomalies - is so heavily damanged by age that seeing the film is hardly worth the effort. Black and contrast levels are extremely weak, fine detail is lost in practically every scene and the ravages of time are glaring and obvious throughout. The audio hasn't been cleaned up either for a slight hiss and some unexpected pops along the way.EXTRAS: Trailers from the other Grant films. Boring, unworthy and disappointing.BOTTOM LINE: Someone should point out to studio executives that films pre-Star Wars are worth the time, effort and, oh yes, the MONEY that is required to make them sparkle like they did when they were premiered.

653333,"Let's get something clear: I love the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, no matter what form they take, from TV shows to comics, but the movies have thus far always been my favorite medium. It takes some serious goofing up on a director's part to make me cast anything less than a fawning eye on my reptilian heroes...but in this case, first-time director Kevin Munroe has made me leave the theatre feeling disappointed, even though I had just been blasted by 87 minutes of my favorite sewer-dwelling ninjas. My god, what went wrong? - the animation was top-notch, the cast featured big names like Sarah Michelle Gellar (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") and Mako Iwamatsu (""Seven Years in Tibet""), and the film had a budget that topped that of all three previous movies. What could have possibly sullied the greatest chance to re-introduce the Turtles to a new generation?In ""TMNT"", the Turtles are a divided clan: with Leonardo (James Taylor, ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"") off honing his skills in Central America, Donatello (Mitchell Whitfield, ""W.I.T.C.H."") and Michelangelo (Mikey Kelley) have pursued dead-end jobs in the civillian sector while Raphael (Nolan North) has turned to fighting crime on his own. Yet, when an ancient and dangerous power summoned by a powerful businessman (Patrick Stewart, ""X-Men"") threatens to be turned upon the city, the Turtles must come together in an effort to save the world....but with personal tensions running high between Leo and Raph, will they be able to remain a team?My first grief is with the story itself: while it'll easily appeal to younger kids and fans of the current TV series, don't the Turtles have enough time in their once-a-week primetime slot to relieve the need for magic and other supernatural elements as plot points? I mean, I know that arguing realism where the Turtles are concerned is a bit of a paradox, but I like to think that the previous three movies held a semi-realism and sophistication that served as a pleasant departure from the buffoonery of the TV shows; I like giant monsters, ancient prophecies, and stone statues coming to life as much as the next guy, but could writer/director Munroe really not come up with anything better than recycled serial fodder for his first feature-length movie?Also, I jumped for joy when I realized that most of the story's arc revolved around Raph and Leo...but my face fell when I realized that it came at the expense of Donny and Mike. While I was pleased by how the movie built on their rivalry (the showdown in the rain is the absolute best confrontation between the two, ever), I saw so little of their other two brothers that I occassionally forgot they existed; other than seeing both at the beginning of the movie and seeing Mike take a tumble on his skateboard, their input to the movie is extremely limited. This carries over into the fight scenes, where we see a few seconds' worth of Don wielding his bo staff and virtually nothing of Mikey swinging his nunchukas while Raph and Leo lead the charge. Shoot, even April (Gellar) gets better fight scenes!Smaller, less signifigant nitpicks include the film's choice of villain (who has no previous connection to the franchise) and the character design, which - apart from the Turtles and other non-human characters - looks like it was taken from ""The Incredibles"", with Max Winters hardly looking threatening as a human charicature and Casey Jones (Chris Evans, ""Fantastic 4"") sporting a chin from hell.On the good side, the movie really is a good example of fantastic CG animation, the voice-casting is fine, the action scenes are exciting (the brawl in the skyscraper takes the cake), and a decent amount of humor reminds me why I liked these guys in the first place. The Leo/Raph wound is re-opened and examined to its most personal level. Small scenes like Mikey sewer-skating and Raph's encounter with the pint-sized (albeit insanely destructive) monster build both character and charm, and make a point that the filmmakers are not entirely without an eye for detail.Alas, there's nothing good enough here to keep my attention beyond a second viewing that merely confirmed my belief in the film's inadequacy as an addition to the pre-existing trilogy. While any TMNT is better than no TMNT, I can honestly say that this latest incarnation has topped TMNT3 for disappointment...but even that one had a little bit for everybody, while the current offering panders to kids and strict CGI-lovers but delivers nothing to the more mature fans of the Turtles.Maybe next time, Warner Bros. will think twice before letting a first-time director at the helm of one of the century's biggest franchises...but until then, we're stuck with this.",N/A

(1/5)New Foundation vs. Orient Express was the best match opf the night so far and that's not saying much but still it was very good.  The New Foundation picks up the win.

660651,"If your expecting an outrageously campy comedy ala' Priscilla, Queen of the Desert or a film like Strictly Ballroom. . . you'll be very disappointed by this one. Although it's written by the writer of The Full Monty, it's a film that misses more opportunities to be funny than it hits. The fact that a lot of that is intentional is not necessarily a good thing at all. It's also the third film of the late 2000/2001 season that's about hair dressers or wigs ( An Everlasting Piece, The Big Tease ).As the film introduces us to its characters we quickly learn than one of them is dying from cancer. This immediately tells us the film is probably not going to be one full of outrageous and John Waters' like camp comedy (Hairspray, Polyester, Pink Flamingos), but rather be more of a bittersweet, heart-warming romantic comedy of a film that has a pretty interesting gimmick --the hair dressing competition. It doesn't seem to be quite sure what it wants to be as it gives us a main character dying of a disease, a Romeo and Juliet type romance, and a low key Rocky kind of film all delivered with a package that should have been over-the-top campy but isn't.The most famous and respected hairstylists from around the world descend upon the tiny Yorkshire village for the annual hairdressing Championships. We meet former resident Bill(Nighy), a cheating egotist who has brought his estranged daughter Christina (Cook) with him to possibly use as his colorist. Bill also learns his ex chief rival Phil (Rickman) is in town and he can hardly wait to gloat over how much more successful and famous he's become. Phil is divorced and has traded in his gold show scissors to run his modest local barber shop with his son, Brian (Hartnett) while not speaking to his ex-wife Shelley (Richardson) who's in a lesbian relationship with his former hair model Rachel (Griffiths). Shelley and Rachel run a full service salon across town. If this isn't sounding too funny to you.. you're right. It isn't. It isn't supposed to be either. But while these aren't the typical characters we've seen in domestic dramas, we've seen the circumstances for this type of drama too many times to be moved or all that interested in any of it.Good thing we're watching charismatic performances. It is also no big surprise that these characters will eventually be involved with each other again and be competing in the hair dressing contest--exactly as you expect. It's probably not a good sign when what should be a quirky out of the ordinary comedy begins with too heavy a helping of pathos and then becomes and remains extremely predictable from start to finish. Most viewers will be way ahead of the film, and there's not real surprises being offered except perhaps that is not nearly as outrageous or campy as you might be expecting it to be. I won't tell you too much more than that about the film because there aren't all that many surprises or laughs in the film and if you are going to enjoy it all you don't need me ruining some of the film's modest surprises.There are several recognizable faced in the film's cast and they are all quite good in their roles. Alan Rickman however is almost too low key for the majority of the film and that's another missed opportunity because he would have been more fun if his role had been written to allow him to play his part a bit more broadly.Let's review: Blow Dry is all wet. It combs over comedic opportunities in favor of immersing itself in a run through of tangled subplots which dulls much of the potential luster and glow the film's gimmick and performances might have had. In short, it's a pleasant but very modest film that offers absolutely nothing to get the least bit excited about except as an opportunity to see an impressive cast.The DVD looks pretty good over all visually and audio wise the main complaint is that some of the fun music cues are mixed too low. The only notable extra is a brief 7 minute behind the scene featurette which is both promotional and informative. It covers the bases in the expected manner and includes brief comments from one of the producers Sydney Pollack.If you watch Blow Dry without expectations and don't want to think too much, it's an enjoyable film with some decent performances, several overly familiar story lines and a nice gimmick (the hair dressing competition). The film's tone is bittersweet as well as comedic and it misses several opportunities for humor making it a light, warmhearted forgettable little truffle of a film. The DVD is pretty bare bones but for those interested in the cast it might be worth a rental.Christopher J. Jarmick is the co-author (WITH Serena F. Holder) of the criticaly praised suspense thriller THE GLASS COCOON.",N/A

209343,"I remember seeing this for the first time when I was in 6th grade about 4 or 5 months after release date in dollar theatre.  I remember thinking at the time ""boy! this is the greatest movie ever!""  I was so used to the original that I mistook the characters of Johnny(Adrien Zmed, then star of TJ Hooker) & Stephanie(then unknown-turned household name mega moviestar Michelle Pfeiffer) as Danny Zucko & Sandy Olsen.  It took me awhile to figure out that these were new goups of T-Birds & Pink Ladies & exchange student Michael(Maxwell Caulfield) would become Stephanie's boyfriend (after becoming a ""cool rider"").Despite poor ratings & nothing based on a Broadway musical w/same characters & story (to best of my knowledge) this is still fun to watch & I recommend for anyone who loves the '50's & '60's & music that makes you want to get up & dance.  The clothes & hairdos are excellent & kind of show how the looks were similar almost at the time the movie was released (new wave, 50's-'60's clean looks, no more tackiness laid-back '70's styles).Similar to both stage & screen of first ""Grease,"" we have twentysomethings, some pushing 30 at the time, playing high school minors & they appear a little too mature & adult looking.  Only exception were Pamela Segall(Delores) & Leif Green(Davey). Ms. Segall was about 14 when the movie was made & young Mr. Green also looks about 17-19.  (I once confused him w/'70's teenybopper Leif Garrett but realized they are two different actors)The musical #'s are great & catchy.  The choreography is also great & it's amazing how talented the T-Birds & Pink Ladies are.  Leif Green makes for a good clumsy, naive, scared-to-fight T-Bird whose bowling ball is too heavy but very flexible if you notice he can do the splits when he jumps up in the ""Score Tonight"" #.  ""Score Tonight"" would probably be my favorite musical # & what I reccommend as a sneak peek for those who have never seen this movie.  ""Cool Rider"" & ""Who's that Guy?"" sound very then-the-style new wave.Chris McDonald(Goose) is so young looking & almost unrecognizable then.  Unfortunately he didnt age very well in appearances in past 15 yrs & seems to be typecast as a nerdy guy in ""Flubber"" & ""Leave it to Beaver.""I wish there were more scenes w/Pamela Segall as she is credited as being one of the Pink Ladies.  I just read on imdb.com that at the time she was involved in an auto accident & stand-in was used for some scenes.  This may also expl why she's not seen w/the other 4 Pink Ladies for most of the movie.  She makes a good tough talking HS freshman Pink Lady.

643563,"AMERICAN DREAMZ is a pitiful mess of a movie, a film that seems as though it wants to be a satire on the Bush administration, on talk show hosts, and on our current state of mindless entertainment that seems to keep high ratings and low IQs neck and neck.The story, what little there is, involves a bored talent show host (Hugh Grant, who looks very down in the tooth) desperate to get out of his mindless role, and hungry for people who are over the edge to come on his popular show and make fools of themselves. He manages to accomplish this from some rather innocent folks as well as the President of the United States (GWB imitator Dennis Quaid, Laura Bush imitator Marcia Gay Harden, and Cheney imitator Willem Dafoe).

That's not necessarily a deal killer for me, but the rest of the movie has to be good enough to make up for it, and it wasn't.One of the big problems was that the movie just didn't feel like it was going anywhere.

903402,"Like many ardent Doctor Who fans, I spent much of the 1990s wondering if the BBC would ever get around to producing new episodes of its signature science fiction program. Well, I should've heeded that old cliche, ""be careful what you wish for,"" because the Beeb did start making Doctor Who again and I ended up sorta hating it.To start, I should try to explain the ... ah ... strange appeal of the classic series. Despite being filmed on the cheap and in a rush, the original Doctor Who generated a lot of witty and engaging episodes, which hold up well for those of us who can tolerate (or even enjoy) camp. To me, the show was always at its best when it was cerebral (e.g., The Aztecs, City Death, Snakedance) while the ""action"" or ""scary"" episodes were much overrated by fans (see Earthshock, or almost any of the Troughton Doctor's kiddie-oriented monster episodes).Alas, this revival series can't really be described as ""witty"" or ""cerebral""; indeed, it throws out the intelligence of the old show in favor of gloopy sentimentality and domestic drama of the soap opera variety. (Will Rose and the Doctor kiss? Or will Rose go back to her doofy ex-boyfriend? Oh, the suspense!) Now, I quite like domestic dramas, when they're well done; indeed, my favorite film director is Yasujiro Ozu, who elevated the genre to high art. But watching this season of Doctor Who, with its shrill cardboard characters (I'm thinking of Rose's mother here) and superficial conflicts, is as far from good domestic drama as Earth is from the sun. It doesn't help that every ""emotional"" moment is underlined by manipulative music, over-the-top acting, and lots of crying.On the plus side, this season had an impressive star in Christopher Eccleston, who may be the most accomplished actor to ever play the Doctor. That said, he is not the best Doctor by a long shot, because showrunner Russell T. Davies didn't use him right. Indeed, throughout this season, Eccleston veers from effective to obnoxious. His overall character - an angry man who tortures a helpless Dalek and practically taunts Rose by showing her the destruction of planet Earth - is not really that nice, or that evocative of the more charming gentleman-genius Doctor of the original series. But at times, Eccleston is a good enough actor to vault over the bad writing and make his Doctor memorable.Like the Doctor himself, the scripts here are uneven. Mark Gatiss writes an excellent episode about Charles Dickens fighting zombies, and Robert Shearman contributes a pretty good script for the Dalek episode (I'm not sure why he wants me to sympathize with the mass-murdering creature, though). Alas, showrunner Davies consistently pens the worst episodes, and uses the series as a showcase for his weird opinions on such irrelevant topics as reality TV and, of all things, weight (one of his villains is depicted as being too thin; another is too fat). Another flaw of Davies' writing is his over-reliance on silly deus ex machina resolutions; the season finale is particularly bad in this regard, as it literally ends with a god emerging from a machine and solving all the Doctor's problems for him!Finally, the production design is also hit-or-miss. British fans and TV critics tend to describe the new Who as a big-budget spectacular, but to my jaded Yankee eyes, this looks like just another cheesy BBC production. The ""redesigns"" of the TARDIS and the Daleks look little better than the originals, the opening credits resemble a screen saver, and the quality of the video footage is poor (the actors' skin tones look orange!) The CGI special effects, meanwhile, improve on the special effects of the original series (anything would) but are still mediocre; I, for one, prefer older Who special effects, which are quite funny when approached with the right attitude. As for the Slitheen, they easily rate among the stupidest-looking Doctor Who monsters in history, and they appear in no less than three episodes of this season. I'll take the Destroyer or the Zygons over them any day...In short, I was disappointed by this revival of Who, and I'm afraid that the show only got worse with time (with the exception of season four, which managed to produce a few good episodes, like ""Midnight""). As for the DVD package itself - well, these episodes weren't filmed in high definition, so they already look a bit dated and rubbish. And the special features mostly consist of the production team congratulating itself for its own cleverness. I prefer more honest, retrospective features to this kind of self-praising stuff.Anyway, while this isn't exactly *terrible* science fiction, it is overrated, and I'd give it a miss in favor of (a) modern sci-fi that's better written, or (b) older sci-fi that's funnier and more soulful. Like, erm, Doctor Who...",Doctor Who: The Complete First Series
1329656,"Also known by the title Murder World, this straight-to-video vampire flick offers a few reasons to make it fairly watchable.  Most notably the beautiful English-Australian pop singer/model/actress Sophie Monk(The Hills Run Red).  She's definitely not your average creature of the night.Brooke and Rhea are a nice young lesbian couple that committed an inconceivable murder at a party back in the 60's.  Instead of being punished, God (a female God btw) decides to recruit them as her tool for destroying evil.  So 40 years later (I guess God is a great procrastinator) these ladies are sent back to Earth as blood-sucking vampire zombie angel lesbians.  Yee-haw.This twist to the genre doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but at least it's something different.  The two fangless femme fatales wander around the desert in their underwear and start a vicious killing spree.  There is a touch of humor and some decent gore effects, but nothing special.  Plus some people might enjoy the moments of gratuitous nudity from the backup actresses.I do feel like the concept of punishing evildoers wasn't developed near enough.  The story essentially consists of one lady vampire killing random people while her partner is conflicted with the senseless violence, despite God's orders.  Anyway, this mission did seem to lack any real purpose.  Why couldn't these sexy bloodsuckers go after terrorists, pedophiles, drug dealers and other scumbags?  There is absolutely no justice in this world.I was surprised by the abrupt ending, which seemed way too rushed.  Anyway, this isn't a complete waste.

566434,"This collection of banned and censored cartoons, as far as I am concerned, is worth a second look from an animation historical perspective. For entertainment purposes, however, this collection just is not very entertaining.To me, about the only cartoon on here worth a second viewing is the classic ""Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat."" The rest of it, to me, was pretty forgetable.The reasons for these cartoons being banned include racism, violence, and sexism (so the video says).The ""Easy Does It"" was definitely a little on the risque side, as it does feature a well-endowed cigarette girl gettin' a backside slap (assumed - not actually seen) from a sexist banker who has the hots for a grocers leggy daughter. The story of that cartoon itself include the grocers daughter initiating contact with the banker to keep him from taking her dad's business into financial ruin - and it's obvious that her visiting the banker (with physical attributes) keep the banker off her dad's case. I agree this is not suitable for children, although this nothing worse than what we see on prime-time sitcoms regularly nowadays.Other cartoons here banned for alleged sexism include ""Cupid Gets His Man"" (naked cupids, but I somehow missed the potential offensiveness of them), ""Christmas Night"" (three men washing in a bathtub [with clothing on] has homosexual overtones - which I didn't get since none of them touched each other) and the military cartoons ""Booby Traps"" and ""Spies"" (sexist overtones featuring a WWII G.I. character - I just didn't like those two cartoons). The ""In a Cartoon Studio"" cartoon also shows a female character being abused for rejecting a male characters advances on her.""Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat"" is just plain LOADED with black stereotypes including ebonic speech, laziness, shufflin' along (as opposed to walking), and a curvaceous black gal who get the black men's eyeballs all but poppin' out of their heads at the sight of the buxome babe in tight, see-through clothing. Keep in mind, though there is some racial stuff that was funny in the 1940's that would be viewed as more ""taboo"" today - and vice-versa.Sometimes it just depends on the audience when determining the potential offensiveness on stuff like this.There is some other ethnic stereotypes here, like drunk Irish cops (""Fresh Vegetable Mystery""), African children eating watermelon (""Making Stars""), and a mammy dressed in clothing reminiscent of slaves from the south (""Little Black Sambo"").There is violence in some of these cartoons, like the beheading of a character in ""Opening Night"", and the bull-whipping of a horse (and later the animal abuser) in ""Be Human"". But this violence was, in my opinion, not any more extreme then the guns and fighting we see on scores of other cartoons we see from MGM or WB.There is nothing in the 13 cartoons on this video that is any worse that what we see on South Park.

872775,"In ""The Grudge 2"" Kayako and Toshio, two horrible ghosts with bone-white skins and goggling eyes (or whatever they really are) return to us. And they just don't return; they have become more ""ubiquitous."" They pop up whenever and wherever they want, and never fail to send signals before they terrorize the victims with strange noise or something else.That means, you can read the pattern; once you do, you only wait for the next scary part to be delivered. The film becomes a series of set-pieces. They are cleverly staged, but they soon begin to be less and less shocking as the film goes on. The dark, brooding photography by Katsumi Yamagijima (famous for collaboration with Kitano) is fantastic, and yes, there are some jump-in-your-seat moments and unpredictable things (like that ""milk"" scene), but nothing really scary or chilling.""The Grudge 2"" has three stories loosely connected to each other (one of them is set in USA though the ""Chicago"" scenes are in fact shot in Japan) and none of them is hard to follow, but none of them is really intriguing either. You don't know what really happened to the main characters until the last chapter where different times and spaces start to merge with skillful editing. (This is a method the director used for his Japanese film ""Reincarnation."") By then, however, most of us have lost interest in the film itself, which only repeats the same trick as the first ""Grudge"" installment.After all with this jumbled storyline, we cannot relate to any of the characters, and we just don't care if someone is dead or survives. There are some nice twists given to the plot (relations between Amber Tamblyn's character and Kayako, for instance), but they are introduced so abruptly that it is neither surprising nor interesting.

481596,"My first exposure to this exposure was in my teens when a male friend and I went to a drive-in movie. We were similar in that our breast experience was limited to suckling at our mother's breasts or accidental encounters with a bare female relative. Therefore, we were both big-time gaga over the ""bigtime"" gaga's that appeared so often on the screen. Every possible excuse (and many times without one) is used to fix the camera on Chesty's massive mammary glands. In our teens, we used to joke about girls that could be dangerous if they spun around quickly, but with Chesty it may not all be a joke. She is huge and saggy.Other than that, this movie has practically nothing going for it, the plot is slow, dull, and it meanders back and forth from plot movement to breast movement. It is difficult to determine which is worse, the acting or the dialog. Fundamentally, Chesty's boyfriend is killed by mobsters, so after a good soaking of her bare breasts by her tears she vows to seek revenge. She then tracks them down one-by-one and kills them by smothering them with her bare breasts.

That Nucci (Francesco) and La Scola (Jacopo) are let down by the strangulated voice of Pendatchanska (Lucrezia) isn't as irritating as the disastrous cuts made to the score. Did Santi think that today's audiences are as tolerant about cuts as they were in the past, or that they wouldn't notice what has been edited out simply because it's a rare work? Not only second verses but also snippets (in fact, gems) here and there are disposed of as if it were an overlong Wagner opera (its total duration when given complete is just under two hours). FOSCARI being my favourite early Verdi opera, I couldn't enjoy this performance: I felt cheated and robbed of many lovely phrases (what a sacrilege to cut two thirds of the finale of the love duet). Despite Roark-Strummer's uneven Lucrezia, I'll stick to the Gavazzeni DVD (recently re-released on the budget label Brilliant): mercifully (though it's still annoying and even weird), only the second verse of Jacopo's Act 1 cabaletta and three short phrases from the end of the Act 2 love duet are cut.

I've heard of the ideas of connectivity and the science backing it up so this film was rather dull.  The film talks little about whats wrong with the world and how to change it and instead talks a lot about life's purpose or the way we should be living life.  There were also very few scientific examples and its mostly just what a few famous people said and that must be the correct way of thinking or behaving.  And thats what really ruined it for me.  The only parts I liked was when the film maker was talking about his life experiences, what he went through and why he changed.

558287,"Viewed: 4/13Rate: 44/13: What seems like a good horror mystery story for C.H.U.D. gets undone by the lazy ending. The film is marked by a series of ups and downs: acceptable story, above than average acting, low intelligence, implausible plot, and enough suspense to keep the pacing going. The last fifteen minutes, especially the idea of gassing the sewers, makes me to think of the storm drains. Aren't they impossible to seal off? That's when I knew the director became lazy as evidenced by the sight of the storm drain in one of the scenes as the police captain gets gunned down. Obviously, the laziness is also manifested in placing the whole mystery on one guy, Wilson, who is supposedly the head of some company. If they are going to place chemicals underground in the sewers of New York City, I am sure that enough people will see that happening and raise alarms. But, the police actually help to cover up the matter. Highly unlikely.

525402,"Harry Potter is a young boy with magical powers.  He lives with his nasty foster family until the age of 11 when he is taken away to Hogwarts, a school of wizardry, for training.  It is here that he discovers his true heritage.  Much like at the Boston pub Cheers, everybody knows his name.  Turns out Harry's family has made quite a name for themselves in the land of wizards and witches.  Eventually he and his two new friends - awkward, put-upon Ron Weasley and snotty know-it-all Hermione Grainger - come to believe that one of their professors is up to some shady business, and venture out on their own to uncover the plot.What follows is an overlong, disjointed picture in which we are shown the many wonders of Hogwarts and occasionally, bits of an actual story.  Shifting staircases and talking hats may amuse the younger ones, but I found it all rather tedious.  The thrust of the story itself doesn't have much logic to it; if the sorcerer's stone is so precious and dangerous, why is it removed from the vault and placed in the care of an inept guard dog (and its equally inept master) to begin with?  The surprise villain isn't clever and serves only to trick the viewer.  Again, kids won't care, but adults will shake their heads in exasperation.I liked the critters.  There are numerous owls of various types, a talking boa constrictor, a shape-shifting cat, and briefly, a large iguana.

The TV shows are based on a series of novels by Kerry Greenwood which I have not read--and now likely won't.The only thing I liked about these shows was the atmosphere created by the talented costumers, set designers, etc. I was disappointed to discover that Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries is ersatz Murder She Wrote. The acting, plots, and direction are hackneyed and the opposite of entertaining. You can easily figure out who the murderer is by: (1) who cries the most over the death, and (2) who appears to be the least likely murderer.This is a 4 disk set that features 13 episodes and also offers extras including cast interviews, information about the sets, etc. These extras are nicely done and more entertaining than the shows themselves.This could have been a great TV show if it had been edgier and less arch.

There was so much wrong with Richard Nixon that there is little justification for making things up. Anthony Hopkins, a magnificent actor, gave a superlative performance and played Nixon exactly the way the Director undoubtedly wanted him to--as a psychopathic, blithering, hard-drinking ape. This is totally unfortunate as he could have made an excellent work of art from this story. Many of the lines attributed to the principal players--like Sorvino's Kissinger saying that had Nixon been loved as a child things would have gone differently--are so fantastic as to boggle the mind. Nixon's relationship with his wife may have been one of the few things the man did right in his life, but Stone infuses their bond with total torment. Why he did these things I cannot fathom. I just finished a biography on the 37th President and his financial shenanigans alone would have been enough to base a movie on. The guy was a big-spending liberal, paranoid, and disloyal. In short, he was an embarrassment to both the right and the left. Why not simply tell the truth? That would be demeaning enough but what we have here is not a man but a total caricature of one.

1207840,"""Vacancy 2: The First Cut"" attempts a prequel of the original film, ""Vacancy"".  The result is a decent film that pretty much accomplishes what it sets out to do, albeit, without the acting of the original.  Basically, the Meadowlake Motel was originally used to videotape its guests having sex with one another.  One night, the owners of the motel discover something they believe to be far more profitable.  Eventually, three people come to the motel for a night, but they get a little bit more than they wanted out of their visit, and the movie turns into a deadly game of cat and mouse from there.Nothing special about ""Vacancy 2"".  It has a decent plot, but the acting is clearly inferior to that of the original.  On the other hand, there is more overt violence in this film than the original.  ""Vacancy 2"" is better than most of the trash we see today, but it's nothing special.  Basically, this is a ""C-"" film which may be worth watching if its on or if you are a big fan of the original.  The objective of this film is to inform the viewer how this business of videotaping violence started, and it does do this to a certain extent, but it fails with the characters in general.  There is no explanation about how the managers of this particular hotel relate to the managers in the original film.

181969,"The Amazon review and all the other hype on this listing might suggest that this is an interesting movie.  Quite the contrary actually.  Though it started off well, it was frustrating how long and slow it was in reaching its anti-climactic ending.  Gimme a break, is about all I could think from the second half on, and for more than one reason.  A ridiculously convoluted, wanna-be artsy plot and typical melodramatic overacting compliments of Jeremy Irons are only half the bargain in Dead Ringers.  The other half is a more or less glacially slow film, that may keep you watching till the end only to realize you'd have done better turning it off and going to bed.If you liked him in Damaged, then you may enjoy this as well.  I will say it wasn't quite as bad as Damaged in terms of melodrama, but it does have a fair dose of 80s cheese about it and yes the 'artiste's' over-zealous flair. Damaged tried to be art, and so did this one, albeit creepier than average ""art"".  Yes, there's something of a gimmick in Irons playing twin brothers with opposite personalities at the same time, and yes, it must have been a trick to get two Jeremy Irons on the screen at once - but beyond this the movie doesn't have much going for it. Its logic and character motivation make sense only in the mind of the twins - the audience will be thinking ""What?!"".  Also, they should have chosen a more attractive female lead.  Her acting was ok but was hard to believe Irons would let himself go to pieces over her.Final analysis: Dead Ringers tries to create a world, a situation, which never comes off as fully convincing, is occasionally self-consciously over-acted by Irons himself, and finally is nothing less than boring from well before it's half over. In terms of generating interest, it comes nowhere close to Cronenberg's better films ""The Fly"" or ""Videodrome"".",N/A

340100,"The premise actually is a very intriguing one for the &quot;classic horror genre,&quot; in that a well-respected doctor, apparently highly regarded for research and innovation that is vaguely left hanging, with a strong religious belief, is approached for healing... and has sufficient idealism to extend the healing arts even to Dracula! Of course, the viewer has no idea of how said doctor was known by Dracula and the Wolf Man, or how he conveniently has the Frankenstein monster on his property, and healing of one who has been dead (then un-dead) for centuries seems excessively ambitious, but the effect remains curiously poignant - the efforts of a man of science, sincerely good, who hopes to find cures for the mind and soul through healing metabolic processes. (That these monsters all had previously died in several feature films is irrelevant - that detail never stopped their reappearance before.)I'm sure I'm not alone (amongst Universal horror film buffs) in having always found Larry Talbot (Wolf Man) to be an extremely sympathetic character. (Remember &quot;The path you walked was thorny, through no fault of your own...&quot; from the original?) This film, in all honesty, is so poorly executed (in the literary sense, since the filmography is good for the genre), and the plot so patchy, largely from seeking to integrate several different and unrelated monster themes, that it is only for fans of the series. Yet it is a great pleasure to see the decent and innocent Larry Talbot cured!Much goes unexplained, of course, and the depiction of the doctor, quite moving in the beginning, is dreadful when, in a puzzling move, a bit of Dracula's blood turns him into (not a vampire but) a mad scientist seeking to kill. The Frankenstein monster would have been well left out, since he plays no real part in anything but the poor ending.Still, it is fun, and just seeing the wolf man restored to health is worth an annual viewing.",N/A

802224,"""Elephant"" attempts to be profound.  We follow long shots of students going through their day, developing film, eating in the cafeteria, etc.  There is a real mix of actors who make it seem very life-like.  However, we need to wade through a lot to get to the promised bang at the end.  The absence of an explanation for what motivates Alex to plan this is perhaps the only way it could be handled.  We see Alex lives in a house where his parents are like absentee landlords.  There appears to be little supervision or interaction.  Moreover, there does not seem to be much love.  When Alex, played by Alex Frost in his only film role I could find, showers with his friend Eric played by Eric Deulen, it seems like maybe at least the boys have found someone to whom they could relate.  However, Alex proves to be a master manipulator.  The scene at the end where his buddy shows up to report on all his kills and receives a bullet to the chest is chilling.  However, this school is strange.  There are empty halls.  Shots ring out and the instructor appears oblivious until he drags a dead student back into the room smearing a blood trail behind him.  I know that this subject is a difficult one.  Nevertheless, I found the film to lack sensitivity and certainly it lacked heroes.  Diane Keaton produced this Gus Van Sant-directed film.

The pulling together of the team, often one of the more entertaining aspects of these types of films, is just not that engaging, despite a good measure of the film being devoted to it. I have no issue with the premise of crafty older guys taking on the mission of this type. It's just that the craftiness isn't well demonstrated, rather they seem to plod through it. There are relationships between a number of the troop, but not very well developed. Action, once finally engaged, is just OK and often repetitious; how many times do you need to see bodies flying through the air as a result of a grenade blast.The double cross by the employer adds interest but their way out of that situation is not terribly inventive or entertaining either, again just more plodding.

For me, the best part of these movies is the humorous interaction between the characters and sometimes the goofy, even improbable storylines. This movie though, is not funny, and it's only marginally entertaining at best. Most of the humor either feels forced or plain just doesn't work.So what's good about this one? I do like that when the boys realized the error of their ways they didn't just apologize but took action to make up for their mistake.

1665127,"It's not often that a movie outright pisses me off.  I see a lot of bottom-of-the-barrel movies for some odd reason, but very few of them make me outright angry for watching them.Nothing Left To Fear made me angry.  I think the biggest reason why is the movie actually starts off well, has likable characters (at first), establishes a good Christian community (at first), looks good and has decent actors.  If the film actually made better use of the people in the main family and continued with being a Christian horror film, it probably could have been good.The problems start when Rebecca (one of the two not-so-teenage daughters) starts having weird dreams.  There turns out to be no reason for her to have these dreams except for perhaps plot convenience and cheap foreshadowing.Second, the story centers around a ritual the town has to perform every once in a while (annually?  bi-annually?  whenever Clancy Brown gets bad vibes?  who knows).  This wouldn't be a bad thing if it ever became clear what the details of the ritual were.  In a good horror story like the video game Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly, the details are very clear: One twin sister has to kill the other twin to appease the god of the village and to keep it from coming out and killing everyone.  Simple, scary and to the point, right?Here, there never seems to be any clear reasoning behind the ritual, except that it's ""God's will.""  Moreover, the ritual is centered around which family member eats a piece of cake with a demon tooth in it.  I wish I were making that up.  Anyway, so the person who eats the tooth-cake (Rebecca's sister Mary) is the chosen one for the ritual, and is subjected to being impregnated by a demon residing in a well.  After a bit of time, the possessed family member then has to go around killing all the non cake-eating members of the family, except for one remaining member, whose blood is then used in the same well to draw the demon back into it for another period of time.  I'm not sure if it matters which family member lives or not, but if it did, the movie never addresses it. Actually, what would have happened if one of the family members turned out to be adopted?  Would the ritual have failed miserably then?As soon as the hell starts breaking loose in the film, the two most likable characters in the family are immediately killed off in unspectacular fashion.  Soon after, the audience is treated to Rebecca abandoning her kid brother Christopher to her demon sister, basically leaving him to die.  In the next scene, she is not seen as distraught, or even concerned, about her brother being in danger.  This scene is particularly horrible because Christopher was the smart one begging Rebecca and her boyfriend to not stand and argue outside the car while a homicidal demon is approaching, and instead do the smart thing and drive far, far away from the demon.So yes, after this scene Rebecca becomes incredibly hateable, and that's bad news because of course she's the main character.  So when it gets to that, what's the point of even caring anymore?  The ending of the movie plays in predictable fashion and the final scene shows the cycle of the ritual will continue; in fact, it's basically a repeat of a similar scene shown earlier in the film.  So there's no good payoff, no lessons learned, and no point to watching Nothing Left to Fear.",N/A

238484,"One of those it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time movies, 1981's Sphinx was one of those pictures that looked so much more promising on paper than it did on screen: based on a novel from the author of Coma, which had been a smash hit a few years earlier, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, who was responsible for Patton and Planet of the Apes, and dealing with the search for a lost tomb and a deadly trade in stolen Egyptian antiquities, it sounded like it should have made for a smart and glossy thriller. It certainly managed the glossy part, with glorious Scope photography of most of the major ancient Egyptian tourist attractions from the pyramids of Giza to King Tut's tomb as well as a cast headed by Lesley Anne-Down, Frank Langella, Maurice Ronet and John Gielgud. It was just the smart bit it never really managed. When she's not telling everybody she meets that she's an Englishwoman who now lives in Boston to explain away her accent, Down's crop-topped Egyptologist reacts to most situations by screaming, even when it would be infinitely safer to keep her mouth shut, and it's pretty obvious that neither of her leading men is entirely to be trusted even if they're not quite as obvious stage villains as John Rhys Davies' smuggler, who actually kicks a dog in his opening scene just to underline what a swine he is.Yet throughout there's the suspicion that, faced with a plot that could have done service in a 1930s programmer despite a few modern retouches, Schaffner and co. have decided not to take it entirely seriously even if they are playing it with an admirably straight face. John Byrum's screenplay certainly seems tongue-in-cheek at times: aside from playing on tourist stereotypes in scenes with Saeed Jaffrey's tour guide, a scene where she hides under the bed from an intruder in her room is played for comedy of embarrassment rather than suspense, one truck chase is filled with throwaway sight gags and the location of the tomb itself, hidden in plain sight, could definitely be said to be taking the urine. Take it on that level and keep your brain switched in neutral for its 117-minute running time and it's entertainingly silly and resolutely undemanding old-fashioned hokum. Expect anything more, and disappointment is inevitable.Warner Home Video's DVD-R boasts a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer and the original trailer.",N/A

1061096,"I have been a huge fan of Edie Sedgwick for the last fourteen years. I was very excited when I heard that a ""real"" studio was actually going to try to make a biopic about Edie. That excitement began to wane when reports that actual Factory cohorts thought the idea of the film itself was disgusting. Turns out that the old Factory crew was spot on. This movie couldn't be further from Edie's actual life.Having poured over Edie's classic biography (Edie: An American Girl), it is more than apparent that the filmmakers took ""artistic liberties"" to new heights. What they couldn't find to be true, they made up. Timelines don't always make sense and people who weren't even that involved in Edie's life take center stage. That said, Sienna Miller's portrayal of Edie is quite good. In fact, the only redeeming quality in the movie is Miller's spot on impersonation of Edie - the girl did her research. Too bad the script (which was presumably written by a few people) wasn't as well researched.My real problem with this movies lies with one thing - the character ""Billy Quinn"" (who is simply credited as ""musician""). Hayden Christensen portrays ""Quinn"" as a thinly veiled Bob Dylan-esque musician who tries to show Edie the shallowness of the Warhol Factory and ultimately becomes the thing that tears Edie and Warhol apart. Anyone that read anything about this film before (or after) seeing it knows that Dylan repeatedly denied being involved with Edie and threatened to sue if he was portrayed in the film. Instead of getting rid of the character completely, the director instead decided to keep him, give a new name and carry on. I don't believe anyone was fooled or didn't guess whom Christensen was actually playing.While I understand that biopics are rarely full of all truths, there is simply  no proof that Edie was romantically involved with Bob Dylan. In fact it has been suggested that any sort of romance between Edie and Dylan was probably more of a one-sided figment of Edie's imagination. Whatever the real story is, I found the whole concept of the character to be uncomfortable. I suppose the filmmakers thought that Edie having an affair with the notoriously private Dylan was much more interesting than the real life affair she had with the less famous Bob Neuwirth (Dylan's best friend at the time).Edie's real reason for leaving the Factory had more do to with her drug use and the fact that she felt she should try to shoot for real stardom. Instead, ""Factory Girl"" portrays Edie as a somewhat helpless girl who is caught between two powerful men from two very different worlds, both of which she wants to belong to. As flawed as Edie was one thing is certain, she did what she wanted when she wanted. Her decision to leave the Factory was most likely her own (she stated at various times that she wanted Warhol to pay her for her work in his films) and likely wasn't based on the affection of any man. The fact that the filmmakers sunk to such depths to get the story they wanted, no matter how untrue it was, is what is the most insulting. I'd rather no movie be made about Edie than the lies and fabrications that made up ""Factory Girl"".If you're interested in finding out more about Edie, don't rely on this movie. Instead, read the few books that cover her life and go on facts, not rumors or hearsay. Edie might have been a cultural footnote, but everyone deserves to have their story told in the most honest way possible. ""Factory Girl"" fails on all fronts and only goes to show that as years go by, people think they can just reinvent history to suit them.The sad thing is, a few of Edie's family members (her widower, who appears as a taxi driver in one scene, and her sole surviving brother Jonathan) participated in the film. That, in and of itself, actually lends some credibility to a movie than deserves none whatsoever.",N/A
1400778,"In a decade of remakes by Hollywood, this is one of many that pales in comparison to the originals.  This version of Conan follows a different story-line than the original two Schwarzenegger films.  Here, we see an origins story of Conan, from birth to childhood, to his learning how to use and forge a sword, the destruction of his family, and his pursuit of revenge.  All throughout are graphic fight scenes high on blood on low on gore.  The special effects are good, though not original.  The dialogue is plain, enough to get the ideas across but nothing inspirational.  The biggest letdown are the lack of comedy and the boring soundtrack.  The original Conan movies had a steady mix of subtle and overt humor; whether it be the camel spitting on Conan, or Conan knocking himself out on a tree.

83753,"There is no denying this movie's technical and stylistic excellence, but Sin City is a pretentious film noir wannabe. It takes gratuitous violence to uninspired levels of depravity, and it pretends at a plot by interweaving multiple storylines and characters, all of which is too clever by half and amounts to a house of cards. This is a movie in which every male character is either a killer or a cop (sometimes both), and every female character is a Black Belt prostitute. Almost nothing makes sense, so you must watch the film as a pure sensory experience - albeit a very gruesome one. Some characters possess supernatural powers; we never discover why.

303984,"I hadn't seen Thelma and Louise in years. I had forgotten everything about it except the attempted rape. It's an okay film but I still don't get how it became such a big hit. I guess the star power of Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon made this film so popular. They definitely brought spark to their characters but other than that this movie is nothing special.Thelma and Louise are two hometown best friends. Thelma is married to a car salesman, Darryl and Louise has a thuggish boyfriend named Jimmy. Other than that, we know hardly anything about these women. The movie begins with a tiny glimpse of their regular lives and then they are off on the open road for the entire film.While at a truck stop bar Thelma meets a man, Harlen who tries to rape her in the parking lot. Louise shoots him and the two take off. From there Louise and Thelma spend their time in hotels, staying clear of the cops.There are many familiar faces as supporting characters such as Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt and Harvey Keitel.The only big problem I had with the film was Thelma's completely unrealistic and annoying behavior. Here she is almost raped and in the next scene she acts like nothing ever happened to her! It was so maddening to see how she behaved. And if that's not bad enough she even has an affair (after almost being raped)! Pathetic and pitiful. That is why it's so hard to take anything that happened in Thelma and Louise seriously. Thelma's actions were despicable and too unbelievable to even comprehend. A huge disservice to people who have dealt with that type of violence and abuse. Even Louise didn't seem realistic. She just shoots a man and her friend is almost raped and she seems to feel nothing. She is just as cold and heartless to Thelma as she could be. Granted Thelma didn't seem like a victim but still Louise could've shown some compassion for her friend. All you get is, ""Shut up, Thelma!"" Louise was very selfish. All she cared about was getting away, not helping Thelma.People always hyped this up as the classic chick flick but to me it makes women look dumb and silly with the things they did. Thelma acts like a two year old and Louise acts like some gunslinger who is living in a fantasy world. Neither of them reacted with any sense. You'd never be able to make this film in today's world and not be criticized for the women acting so dumb.Another thing about this movie is it looks very dated even for being made in 1990. It looks more like it was made in the early 70's. The quality of the film hasn't held up well at all.If you haven't seen this film in all these years you probably never felt the need to. Whether you ever check it out is up to you but you're not missing much if you don't.",N/A
115566,"Gag me.  This is everything I hate in a musical.A family in the suburbs of St. Louis are living their life happily while their two eldest daughters, Rose and Esther, contemplate love and marriage.  The beginning sets off the tone nicely: ""How is this ketchup?"" ""Oh well it's too sweet...""  ""What do you think?""  ""Oh, much too flat.""  Indeed, the movie was nice enough to use its own device to describe what's wrong with it: sickly sweetness and flat tones.I haven't a problem with Technicolor or sweetness, but these people look like they're made out of marshmallow peeps and St. Louis looks like Candyland.  Even the muddy street looks edible!  Even when worries come up, there's never really any conflict, just a bunch of stretches to try to find a good way of fitting another song in; basic musical conceit, keep setting up songs and it's fun for the whole family.Now the singing is absolutely excellent, I'll give it that, but the music isn't particularly remarkable and the lyrics are terrible.  However, it's all in the name of good family entertainment.Honestly, if it wasn't for the singing and the relatively compelling character of Tootie, who despite her cutesy name and her cutesy image is something of a fledgling sadist, it'd be hard to really care about the plot...  wait a minute, plot?  You mean the thing where these characters  fall in love, then fear a move, then don't move, then just go back to being in love?  Oops, looks like we forgot something.Something else is a bit confusing about this movie... it's set in 1903... so why does nothing about it feel like 1903, at all?  It's so incredibly anachronistic it's appalling.  But see, we're not supposed to focus on any of these things, we're only suppost to feel happy and lovely that everything works out in the end, or something.  It's dated escapism; very little of it seems really appealing or even important theseadays.  I'm sure if you're looking  for a way to ""fall in love all over again"" or something, this could be a good movie to cosy down to, but then again, there's a lot better out there for just that same purpose.--PolarisDiB",N/A

614983,"The film opens with two families going through their morning ritual. Tim Dingman (Ben Stiller) is married to Debbie (Rachel Weisz). He commutes to work with his neighbor Nick Vanderpark (Jack Black) who is married to Natalie (Amy Poehler). All this is done while listening to Leon Redbone. The film had actors and a musician who I love, yet I wasn't grabbed by the action.Nick is a dreamer who doesn't focus. He is thinking of inventions all the time. Tim is the conservative of the two and appears to be in a more senior position at work. Nick gets an ideal of a spray that will make dog poo disappear so people don't have to pick it up. He offers Tim a chance to go 50-50 into his idea. Tim doesn't think will work.The ideal takes off and about 15 minutes into the film, the action begins with the characters not yet established. The ""envy"" aspect builds way too fast.  Christopher Walken enters the film as ""The J-Man"" and attempts to relate Tim's microcosm dilemma to the overall workings of society, something the script does rather poorly...or poo-ly. The film moves to a low point of envy in the nude (waist up on camera) men hot tub scene.Like the rest of the script, the expected ending comes at you rather quickly and not too well developed or funny.Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, no nudity, no sex.",Envy
530277,"'Lost Souls' makes an effort to be a film that ranks up there with 'The Exorcist' but it doesn't quite succeed.  I agree with the majority of the reviews posted here regarding the spectacular cinematography.  The director manages to create an dark atmosphere that literally screams suspense.  However, this does not compensate for the weak, unoriginal storyline and sub-par performances by some of the actors.  Wynonna Ryder's performance in particular, is flat and downright unbelievable.  She fails to inject any real emotion or drama in her performance whatsoever, which seriously damages the film.  We don't view her as the unlikely hero, the saviour of mankind, just as an annoyance whose whole approach is 'ho hum, been there, done that'.  Ben Chaplin is equally middle-of-the-road in his performance, although I think he did what he could with what he was given.  They tried to focus on creating a sympathetic and likable character, but he and Ryder have NO on-screen chemistry, which certainly didn't help.  You end up waiting for some big thing that never happens (well, until the end). John Hurt manages to steal most of the scenes that he is in...and even manages to out-act Ryder when he is supposed to be in a coma (what does THAT tell you).It was a extremely good move to keep the so-called exorcisms reduced to distorted, half-seen segments, filled with screams of agony and terror.  This forced the viewer to rely on their imagination, as it is the unseen, the unknown, is usually what provokes the most fear.  For example, take the first 'Alien'  'Halloween', 'Psycho', or 'Nightmare on Elm Street' for example. You never really got a good look at that alien, Michael Meyers, Norman's Mother or Freddy Kruger in the original version of any of these films.  That's what made it so damn scary as our childhood fear of the dark or the boogeyman, were justified time and again.  This was one of the few redeeming qualities of the film because when film-makers rely on in-your-face tactics, it usually ends up just being unrealistic and cheesy special effects.  However,this film tends to take itself too seriously in its efforts to make it a new twist on an old story, and frankly, it just doesn't cut it.  It relies on the same old religious references and 'evil' icons.  The cinematography and the surprise ending are really the only thing that make this film worth watching.  Rent it first, you'd have to be a pretty serious fan of this genre or Ryder or whoever to find it worthy of a purchase.",N/A

120288,"Any Given Sunday feels longer than it's 151 minutes, mainly because it tries to cram too much in. Oliver Stone is a fine movie director although his recent offerings have been paltry, including this one. The violent and break-neck on-field action is captured perfectly. The problem lies within the movie's insipid two-dimensional characters. Al Pacino brings a wearied cynicism to his role as Coach D'Amato and is excellent as usual. The only other credible characters are a cocky halfback played by professional rapper LL Cool J, and Matthew Modine as a conscienious team doctor.The second disc of this 2-disc set features screen tests, including a home video of Jamie Foxx tossing a football in a park. It also features a 'making of' plus there are deleted scenes with commentary by Oliver Stone. If you enjoyed the movie, I definitely recommend this movie for purchase for it's superb extras.Many will find this movie slow-moving despite the football action, though. It's standard fare as far as football films go. There is nothing here that hasn't been done already which leads one to re-think the whole football film genre.Unless you are a football fan, stay well away.",N/A
1155285,"While I was impressed by Winslet and DiCaprio's acting, I couldn't believe how predictable and unoriginal this film was. How many films do we need to remind us that the 1950s wasn't such a great time to be alive? And that all those neatly manicured lawns and sharp-looking fedoras came at a price? I assume films like this are aimed toward Baby Boomers who bore younger people with endless tales about how great their 1950s childhoods were. For the rest of us, this is just a soap opera. Yes, there was conformity. Yes, there wasn't a birth control pill and women had to do their own abortions. Yes, men had to be the sole breadwinners and had to put their family first. Yes, the suburbs are soul-killing and boring. Even Winslet's role felt derivative, an updated version of her character in ""Jude the Obscure"". Every plot twist was signaled a mile away. When DiCaprio eyes a sexy brunette in the office, I said to my friend, ""they will have an affair."" They do. When Winslet starts dancing with her handsome neighbor, I said, ""they will have an affair."" They do. When DiCaprio goes back to being an office drudge, I said, ""she will kill herself, I bet."" And she basically does. No surprises, just a drawn out melodrama with doses of star power, some self-important social commentary and yes, the enlightening revelation that the 1950s were, indeed, a repressive era.",Revolutionary Road

642395,"Certain films just scream a purchase to me, even blind buys. The Fly and Dr Strangelove were pure blind buys and I didn't regret them. Sometimes though a film comes out and you just have to test the waters. Well going to the video store, I found out I got a free rental so I was very curious about Hostel so got that. Well, that saying of ""I want those 90 minutes back"" certainly applied to me. ""Scariest movie in a decade""? Liars.2 Americans and a Icelandic friend are in England backpacking looking for, what else? Women, particularly soon-to-be naked willing women. They overhear a story of a place that has incredibly easy girls who just love American accents. Well getting there, they meet 2 girls and soon they get suckered in to an odd place: people who pay to torture and kill people for a price, and wouldn't you know it? Americans fetch a mighty fine price.Like Land of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, the Saw films and Wolf Creek, the film tries to horrify by showing disgusting images such as severed limbs or any other nasty business. Hostel doesn't delve into it right away but there's still a kind of pointless feel to it all. When the carnage starts happening, I can just imagine the filmmakers going nuts because they just wanted to make a violent movie. Gore can be used in a more artistic fashion such as war films but here it just feels violent just for the sake of it.What piqued my interest was this guy at the college mentioned the film and one of the gory shots and a woman in the class said ""every guy his age should see that film"". Whether she meant it as ""boys will be boys"" who will see those nudity/violence filled movies or it shows commentary on a thing apparently guys love to do: go overseas and bed ""hot European chicks"". To be honest, I never was into that, preferring the romance and chase angle but this is a commentary and it's a well-told one at that, it's just too bad it's on a ridiculous and pointless movie.If you want good horror movies, check out the Exorcist or the Shining or Carrie but if you're into gory stuff, you'll love it.

961002,"After watching this flick, I had to ask myself why.  Why did I think this would be even entertaining?  Why did I pass up other movies that I've actually heard of to watch this?  I suppose I don't really have answers, but I will shy away from such movies in the future.Okay, the movie had promise.  The plot sounded good.  The background sounded really good.  If this was a true story (the sanitarium, anyway), it would be an interesting bit of history.  I guess I should have known the acting would be subpar.  But the movie as a whole was subpar...a true triple bogey.There were a few good scares here and there.  The problem was that these scares were shown three, four times.  It stopped being frightening after the first time.  The credits state that the film was ""shot, cut, and directed by.""  That, at least, was accurate.  There was much cutting and pasting.  Flash backs, flash forwards, flash whatevers.  I would bet that the 90+ minute movie consisted of 50 minutes of actual footage.I do not recommend this movie.  I found myself hoping it would be over.  The ending was not good...just a cheap, ""bet you didn't see that coming"" scene that elisted a yawn from me.",Death Tunnel
656598,"So, I did the dumb thing and read the short story just before watching the movie, so take that into account when reading this review.The movie itself was watchable, if a little disjointed and somewhat hard to follow, but saying that it's based on Kings story is more of a cruel joke than an accurate description.Two characters in the book made it into the movie, but since they were the only two chacters in the book (the writer and the hotel manager), it would have been impossible to leave them out.  Apart from that, I counted 3 vague references to the book.  3.The film makers added several chacters, presumably for us to hate.  The ex-wife made me want to punch her in the face within 2 minutes of being on screen.  When your ex calls you, obviously freaking out and tells you to call the police and save his life, you don't start whining about how he didn't call you when he got into town.  She was begging to be hated, which seems to be the only reason she was in the movie - because trying to build a background for the writer failed miserably.Then starts this whole thing where the room tries to convince him he seeing his dead daughter, and he starts to lose it.  again, adding characters to the story that weren't needed.I'm just disgusted with this movie.  The book made the room a truely malevolent entity.  The movie made it a kinda creepy and surreal place to be, it was so watered down if I didn't know it was based on the book I never would have recognised it.  The stupid film didn't even get the pictures on the wall right!!!!Things that really pissed me off because it wasn't supposed to happen: He left the room (at least he thought he did), he interacted with other people while in the room, he was able to contact people outside the room, he crawled around the freakinig vents and found a dusty corpse that of course (in crappy, predictable movie fashion) came to life and chased him through the ducts, the list could go on for as long as the movie, which seemed endless.Honestly, it was such a struggle to watch the last half hour, I didn't think I would get through it, but I had to see how much more the film makers could screw up the story - and on that point they take the cake, all of the cake, even the crumbs.Then the writer dies at the end, which wasn't supposed to happen, and the story was much more disturbing knowing that for the rest of his life he had to sleep with the lights on so when he woke from his nightmares he instantly knew he was not in that room any more.John Cusack delivers an amazing performance, and is really the reason to watch this movie, the only reason.  He is believable, genuine, and with all the other things I hated about this film, I still found him compelling.Sam Jackson was good as well, but his character was poorly written and in no way resembled a hotel manager.Conclusion:  Skip the movie and read the story.

I saw this film simply because I thought I can see awesome 'Bill' image, the kind of Oscar worthy terrific performance from Carradine.Sorry, but no such things here, partly because of the film's weak script and the equally weak acting from Carradine.  He plays the titular 'Monster Hunter' from FBI, in a MIB suit, who investigates the serial killer case in a small town in Texas.  His method is very unconventional -- some ritualistic prayer before lit candlesticks, for instance -- and not exactly a hero of the film.Actually, 'Monster Hunter' is shot in a so-called mocumentary style, showing a series of interviews including the killer's mom, parents of victims, and the psychological analysis of one doctor.  Also you gradually come to know how the real killing was done through the narrative told in between.You soon realize that this is a film made in a tongue-in-cheek mood, twisting the rules of the horror genre.  The idea is interesting, but it has been done much more effectively in three 'Scream's, and compared to them, the mock documentary style is, I think, not a suitable one, for it always wavers  between feeble gags and tedious thriller.  There are some good moments -- either shoking or funny -- but they are not many in number.And like I said, Carradine is no Bill here, whose irresitible charms made Uma Thurman's 'the Bride' fall in love with the guy.

They need to revamp their set list and think of some new ways to wow the audience. There should have been more Tommy and Peter as well. I'm sure being at the show was a lot more exciting.",N/A
1393051,"While the artistic merits of this film can't be ignored or denied, the rest of it is truly a waste. I wanted to shut it off after about 20 minutes, and I have a very high annoyance tolerance for films. Visually, it is stunning but combined with a non-linear story-line, an odd plot and wasted acting, The Tree of Life is simply a bore. You can't even really summarize this film properly. During the 50's three sons are seen growing up in a typical home with a somewhat strict (but not bad) father and now, in present day, the eldest reflects on his sad past. Why is he so angry and resentful? Who knows, because the mere glimpses we get are not nearly enough to establish anything. Sean Penn plays the modern day son and I'm pretty sure he doesn't utter a single word in the entire movie except a random whisper to the viewers. In fact, I read recently that while he was on set, he had no idea what he was even doing there because he apparently didn't know what the point of his role was... Brad Pitt plays the 'stern' father back in the past (and does a marvelous job actually) but again, his character is never fully fleshed out so we only get a surface picture of him. Jessica Chastain is the mother, who wanders the film aimlessly, loving her boys and husband, but never speaking a word of importance. She does love washing her feet alot though...... There's also alot of whispering in the movie.The one redeaming factor is the beautifully haunting score. I didn't realize until the credits that Alexandre Desplat conducted this. He is my new favorite composer after hearing his work in other recent films. It really is a glorious and noticable score and I only wish the actual film could keep up with it. At well over 2 hours, it was hard not to fidget and constantly check the time. The ending was just....odd. But by that point I was so past caring I didn't even try to break it apart frame by frame like I usually like to do. This is not a fantasy(or is it??) but it does contain dinosaurs. Like I said; odd. I was told beforehand you will either love it or hate it and I think I know which end I am leaning on.",The Tree of Life [Blu-ray]

281060,"One of the countless horror films to try to take advantage of the success of John Carpenter's Halloween, He Knows You're Alone was a carbon copy of Carpenter's classic before, and it still is to this day.  Not to mention that the film is more dated than ever, is chock full of almost non-existant and wooden acting, and a horribly executed take on the slasher killer.  The blood in the film is almost non-existant, which isn't such a bad thing considering director Armand Mastroianni was trying to go for a ""less is more"" angle, but He Knows You're Alone is one of those rare cases where more would probably have been better.  The film is famed mostly for featuring a young Tom Hanks in his first screen role, which encompasses about five minutes of screentime.  Whether you want to see Hanks in the beginning of his career, or you want a nostalgia trip down the 80's slasher road, He Knows You're Alone isn't utterly horrible and is worth a look if you've never seen it, but with so many superior films of the genre out there, your better off with something else.  Warner Bros. decided to put a few extras on the disc for it's DVD debut, including trailers and a worthwhile commentary by director Armand Mastonianni and writer Scott Parker.",He Knows You're Alone VHS

The picture has acceptable high defintion sharpness for about a third of the movie. In the other two-thrids however, the scenes are obviously soft and blurry. I had read reviews on 2 Hi-Def websites that indicated this was the case but I decided to take a chance on this movie anyway because it is one of my favorites. The negative reviews on the other websites were to optimistic. The picture quality is even worse than they said. Not only does the picture become soft right before ever dissolve from one scene to the next, but many scenes between dissolves are also soft. The purpose of Blu-Ray  movies is to enjoy 1080p quality high-defintion and this movie fails to deliver.

1557769,"Evil Dead returns to its horror roots. The remake suffers from the lack of Raimi or Campbell's involvement. They are associated with this film but their personal stamp of approval doesn't seem to be on it. Raimi's influence doesn't show up and Campbell appears in the end credits. It's almost as if they were hired solely to promote the film. The good news is that it is very gory. The bad news is that they don't take it to the next level. This is not the cabin in the woods I was expecting. The Evil Dead was legendary as a horror film. I can still connect with the original or sequel (you don't see that camera work everyday). It's so much fun and scared the wits out of people in the 1980s (it was the #1 movie rented in more than one country for at least a year). It revolutionized the demonic POV shots that grab you. The remake is fairly loyal to the original storyline. It unfolds almost exactly the same way with different camera work and actors. Some of the best elements of the original are here (e.g. the perverted pencil and basement zombie) but they just seem inserted and not crucial to the plot.Ultimately the remake doesn't offer more story or character development and is much less memorable. It could have been amazing with Raimi's involvement. After all, he made some awesome movies on a low-budget and then became a big success in Hollywood so he has learned so much since the 1980s. Yet he handed the directorial reins over to Fede Alvarez. The teens show up in an isolated cabin before the dead come to life. My main complaints are the acting, props, story and CGI. The cast is mostly forgettable. The acting featured one atrocious scene that reminded me of The Ring. This actress in a blue screen was whispering while surrounded by zombies with the music blaring full-blast. The scene either didn't support her, she was in the wrong movie or she simply lacked direction. The prop for the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) was rather lame. I'm not sure many demonologists use red magic markers to write in an ancient, priceless manuscript when they want a spell on summoning the dead. The CGI hollows out this movie to the point where so much is happening that you can't connect with the characters or action. This Blu-ray has about 39 minutes of bonus content and an audio commentary (Director Fede Alvarez, co-writer Rodo Sayagues, Jane Levy, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas). That is fairly light treatment for such an iconic horror franchise. I must admit the Blu-ray picture quality is good and the audio is very good. I would be interested in purchasing an Evil Dead 1-4 box set on Blu-ray. Evil Dead fans deserve the deluxe treatment!",N/A

332330,"All my life I heard about that great science fiction classic - 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I finally decided that it was time to give it a try. So, dragging my teenage son along with me I put the DVD in the player and gave it a watch.On the plus side, the movie is visually stunning with many great scenes of space and spaceships that still impress some forty years later! The soundtrack is quite interesting, with an interesting mix of classical pieces and vocal pieces that put you on the edge of your seat.On the minus side, the movie moves with a glacial slowness. By the time the intermission drifted around, my son was so bored that he got up and went to watch television. I stuck with it, and was rewarded with a second half that was worse that the first. In general the second half made me think of a bad acid trip, of the sort that interested 1960s viewers, but nobody afterward. And, to make matters worse, it was an acid trip in slow-motion.At the end of the movie, I felt terribly disappointed. I am a huge science fiction fan, and yet I found the movie to be ambiguous to the point of irrelevance, leaving me with no positive feelings whatsoever. So, let me just say that while the movie is visually stunning it is murderously slow and uninterestingly ambiguous. I feel like I wasted two good hours on this movie, and I will definitely not watch it again.",N/A
1142222,"Let's take a look at this film in all its wonderful elements.  The premise - unique perspective on the horror genre.  With such a great idea, why was so much time (actually any time) wasted on the schlock pseudo-sex scenes?  What a waste.  That was time that could have been used to develop the plot.  This film felt like a twist on the old Stephen King Creep Show piece.  The main difference is that King knows how to deliver suspense without wasting time on unimportant minutia.  The characters - sort of pretty well developed.  Granted, not enough to actually care about any of them, but they were better developed than some horror films.  The antagonist (the evil weeds) - wow, I would have liked to see this entire theme better explained.  Maybe if the film-makers had cut the entire first 20+ minutes of this feature and spent that time on the actual ruins, well, then we might have had a 3 star film.

739535,"So many people are tied up in the politics of Michael Moore, they fail to realize that documentary is an art form.  It is an artistic means through which to examine a thesis.  I like Moore's work in general, but find the &quot;Columbine&quot; film to be sorely lacking in clarity.  In a nutshell, the film's thesis (assuming it has one) is kind of &quot;wishy-washy&quot;.  I watched the film once and kept waiting for Mike to &quot;get to the point&quot; and found that his gift for sardonically presenting bitter ironies and &quot;slapping viewers awake&quot; was wasted on subject matter that is perhaps best left in the perview of Criminologists.  Then, to see if it had any redeeming educational value, I watched it again and drew the same conclusion about the movie.  I was very disappointed.As I said, I like Moore and I will gladly rethink this review if someone can prove me wrong by telling me in a sentence or two, what *exactly* the thesis is.  Is it a statement on the state of youth of America?  Is it a statement about spoiled rich kids who kill their classmates?  Is it a statement about parents, the educational system...gun control...what...why?  Who is to blame for the terrible events in Columbine?  Alas, the film raises tons of questions, but answers none.While many people have criticized the film for pushing a political agenda related to gun control, this is perhaps Moore's most objective documentary.  People who see an &quot;anti-gun agenda&quot; in this film are just seeing what they want to see based on thier emotions about Moore.While watching Columbine, I actually got the feeling that Moore himself was uncomfortable with the grayness of the subject matter.  It's almost as if Moore was aware that a strong pro-gun control argument would put him at odds with the constitutional freedoms that he has spent the better moments of his career defending.  As a result, the film tends to branch out into too many areas (such as Militia groups, popular music, popular cultural notions about guns, etc.) leaving the viewer with a general impression that yes, we do live in a &quot;Gun Culture&quot; - but knowing this fact may or may not provide any adequate solution to the next Columbine.The result of the muddled thesis, however, might have given  Moore the appearance of &quot;neutrality&quot; that I suppose it takes to win an Oscar.  Or perhaps that was Hollywood's indirect way of acknowledging that he had deserved credit for earlier (and much better) work.  No matter, fans of Mike will acknowledge that he is better as a documentarian when his work puts him at odds with big corporations and big government.  He should stay away from the &quot;garden-variety&quot; crime issue.Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this film is it's break away from the traditional &quot;Moore style&quot; which is laced with genuine humor and clever camera-work.  There are a few chuckles when Moore opens an savings account at a Northern Michigan bank and gets a &quot;free shotgun&quot; for his patronage, but the film is otherwise humorless.  The camera-work in the film is as sophmoric as any piece on 60 minutes.  Contrast this to Mike's quick-cut camerawork and shocking transitions in Roger and Me!With regard to Moore's the issue of content, the movie doesn't fare to well either with Mike bouncing footage around from Militia groups to interviews with celebs, and so on.  There seems to be no linearity in his presentation whatsoever.Moore is definitely out of form on this one.  I would however, give him two stars.  One for a valiant effort to root out the etiology of the Columbine incident. And another for showing enough refrain so as not to make any sweepingly bold and overpowering statements in the foggy area of gun control, in spite of the way in which many people seem to have interpreted Bowling for Columbine.",Bowling For Columbine VHS
1055475,"There were several problems with this film.  The major ones being a terrible screenplay and an even worse cast.  I'm sure by now, many are sick of the comparsions to LOTR, but Peter Jackson set a standard for fantasy movies that is going to be hard to live up to.  Jackson did an excellent job of casting LOTR and writing the screenplay.  He kept true to the essence of the story.  This was not the case with Eragon.Eragon was almost completely miscast.  The characters of Brom, Arya, Murtagh, Galbatorix, and Durza (the Shade) were all wrong.  I thought the choice for Eragon was ok, but because of the poor script, he came off dull.  Djimon Hounsou was a good choice for Ajihad, but again, the terrible dialogue didn't show his talent.  Jeremy Irons as Brom was awful.  What's actually funny is that he probably would have been better cast as Galbatorix!  And then there are the ""monsters"" of the film, which were less than scary.  Urgals are fat, bald men?  And what the heck were the Ra'zac?  Again, here is where Jackson shines!  The Wraiths, Orcs, Goblins, and Uruk-hai of LOTR were all eerie, scary, and menacing to watch on screen.  Eragon's monsters are portrayed this way in the book, but Fangmeier could not convincingly translate them onto the big screen.While I didn't mind the changes that Jackson made to LOTR, and even found some of them to be more exciting than what really happened in the book, i.e. Helm's Deep (sorry LOTR fans); Fangmeier was not as adept at this.Overall, this movie was poorly made.  The  true essence of the plot was lost and the movie came off ""cheesy"" at times.  If there is going to be an adaptation of the sequel, Eldest, I will not mind at all if they completely change the cast and crew for that film!

Guy Fawkes had more in common with the autocratic government of this story than with the resistance.  (2) The victory against the dictator had been won before the Parliament building was destroyed, and that victory came from the leader being parodied and mocked on TV.  V's destruction of the Parliament building was an act of anarchism - destruction of institutions simply because they are institutions.

731002,"&quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; is based on Bret Easton Ellis book of the same title, and the fact tells you all; like the previously filmed &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; and &quot;American Psyco&quot; the characters spending time aimlessly in university are not your oridinary clean-cut all-American boys and girls.  But let me hurriedly say that that is not a problem at all here (in fact, not everything about them is repulsive as some critics suggest).The real problem can be found in the name of the director, Roger Avary, who once was working at a local video shop with a film buff called Quention Tarantino.  Unlike his ex-pal, however, Avary's filmic technique are only a showy performance -- split-screen, fast cutting, backward-running shots -- everything is at first mildly funny to see, and then he overuses them.  And we realize that the characters are not well-rounded or interesting in any way (I mean, how many people really care if college students drink so much as the film shows?  We are long past the stage when we are easily shocked by them, living in the time of the internet, you know.)The story is actually a string of loosely connected episodes around drug-dealing (and brother to another Bateman in &quot;American Psycho&quot;) Sean Bateman (James Vab Der Beek) and Lauren Hynde (Shannyn Sossamon).  It starts with a party scene where every students got drunk and stoned, and among them we see these two not-quite-happy.  And you are introduced to other characters played by Ian Someholder, Kate Bosworth, and Kip Pardue (though the last two's screen time is fairly short,  Plus you get cameos of Faye Dunnaway and Eric Stoltz.Sean wants to sleep with Lauren, who is in love with another guy.  Sean then sleeps with different girls while Paul Denton (Ian Someholder) is attracted to him.  Every character wants something which they cannot have, and the only thing they can do is &quot;deal with it.&quot;These characters are all shallow and self-centered, but remember, Tarantino has shown many killers in his films and can make them quite engaging and lively presence.  No chance here.  Roger Avary insists on his own &quot;realism&quot; so that Dowson's Creek Van Der Beek must show us how he spends his time in bathroom.  All is done as if saying, &quot;How about that?&quot;  Sorry, but we are not impressed, after watching &quot;Kill Bill&quot; lately.Possibly except for Ms. Sossamon, the acting is of lower kind that would explain why these actors have not achieved higher or bigger level of works after their once memorable performance in career.  They need another agent who has seen Avary's tedious &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; disaster, and can give better advice on their choice of jobs.I do not disagree with the shallow characters -- we may resemble them in some way or other -- but the shallow way of presenting them.  But more fundamental questiuon is the film does not answer the question -- why should we watch this film (which still smells the bubbly 80s) now in the 21st century?",The Rules of Attraction VHS

And I readily admit that this is not nearly as bad a movie as that would make it out to be; it's paling in comparison to the company it's been keeping on my retinas. It's not the worst movie I watched that weekend, even (that would be the execrable 2008 remake of It's Alive), but it's derivative, badly-acted and -directed and all-around silly. You deserve better than this. Give me a few and I'll tell you how you can get it.Deborah Martin (Star Trek's Lisa Vidal) is a former photographer who gave up her career to get married and start a family. The batch of them, Deborah, husband Jim (Flight of the Living Dead's David Chisum), and son Ian (Joshua Pelegrin in his first and, to date, last big-screen role), are moving out to the country to get away from it all. They look at an endless succession of houses, but there's one that they step into, and immediately Deborah is taken with it. (You've heard this before, right?) After dithering on so many other houses, when she says ""we'll take it"", Jim is thrilled he can finally stop looking at houses, and they do. Deborah soon learns that the house was originally inhabited by a reclusive, possibly crazy, painter who may or may not have killed his entire family and hidden them somewhere in the house. More importantly, their spirits may be trapped in the house's mirrors. (You've heard this before, right?)It gets better. The big twist ending has been done to death. In fact, the movie is often compared, and never favorably, to a classic flick that has the same twist ending. It's also been done more recently in two excellent movies, and I'm not even considering the genre classic that started it all, and the almost-as-excellent homage to it that came out thirty years later. (I'm avoiding names in order to avoid spoilers; if you want to know the films I'm talking about, they'll be at the bottom of the review after spoiler space.) As well as, naturally, any number of dozens of movies that have tried it and failed miserably. This is only one of a huge crop. It doesn't help that few of the actors in this movie are any good, and those who are are relegated to stereotype roles at best (Lupe Ontiveros is the most visible member of this cast in that regard). Writer/director Pablo Proenza was working on his first feature-length movie. He's not an awful director, and maybe if he'd had some original material and a few decent actors to work with, he might have come up with something worthwhile.

857714,"Let me preface this review by saying a review should include all aspects of the DVD, from content to quality of packaging to digital transfer.  The fact I think Next Gen is one of comprehensively best Sci-Fi shows possibly in the history of television is the only reason this piece of crap set even gets two stars.  So, as a disclaimer, if you've never watched the TNG, then you owe it to yourself to wade through this junk if for no other reason the fantastic content of the show.  Especially towards the end of the series, this matured into a show that is near and dear to my heart, and I love the characters and the universe they inhabit.So, as for the rest: pure, unadulterated horse manure. I'm not kidding, I have old episodes I VHS taped from basic cable on medium tape speed that look better than the transfer they've done on these.  Its horrid.  Artifacts abound, the Dolby 5.1 is all over the place, there is more ghosting than a reality haunted house show...I could go on, but the summation is, they put little to no effort whatsoever into making this even digital quality (except for the menus).  Speaking of reality TV, it is insulting that reality TV drivel get regular Bluray releases and this, an 8 season series with history on both ends and a huge fan-base, get what could possibly be the fastest production mastering of any DVD release to date.

608565,"This will be short, partly because, unlike I & II, III has at least a consistent story line. Mr. Lucas had to accomplish a certain number of things to link with the next film, so he could spend less time on tangents. One could point out that, as the possibility of ever-more-spectacular SFX becomes reality, the film depends too much on mere visual glitz--the opening battle being a good example, in that it is not clear to the viewer exactly why the battle is being fought (or who wins it, for that matter), but we must accept that Mr. Lucas and his coterie of animators and computer mavens have pretty well been seduced by the dark side of the... I mean, have reached the point where in their minds flashy things on the screen are a desirable substitute for story and acting.My chief objections are about the end of the film.First, we learn that Anakin joins the Sith primarily because he hopes to save Padme from death. But the Emperor tells him that this can only be done with additional research. (""If we work together, I know we can discover the secret."") But since Padme is supposed to die in childbirth, and is nine months pregnant, it does not seem that there is much time to get this research done, does it? Anakin might at that point have realized that Palpatine can actually do nothing to save his wife, and has been lying to him.Padme's death: entirely unconvincing. We are told she is in good health. We see that she is conscious and rational: she names her children. Then she dies. Of a broken heart? But would not the birth of two healthy children, and her maternal desire to raise them, keep her alive? Would she die and abandon them? Now, Padme's demise was actually caused by the plot of the film: since Luke S. has no living mother in Parts IV-VI, Mr. Lucas just had to get her out of the way. Why he chose to do so in so unconvincing a manner I don't know. But, then, screenwriting has not been his strong point in the last few years.""Hidden, safe, the children must be kept"" says guess who. Yes, fine. How shall we do this? Well, let's give the girl to Bail Organa, one of the most conspicuous figures in the Senate, one of three people nominated for Chancellor when Valorum was forced out. (Would not the sudden appearance of a baby girl in his family attract at least a tiny bit of attention? Adopted? Where is the paperwork?) As for the boy--""to Tatooine and his family send him"". (Ha! That will fool the Emperor--he'd never think of looking there.)George Lucas should have hired a writer--several writers. He simply no longer has the imagination and skill to write good scripts. He is mainly interested in spectacle and SFX (and marketing. Several times I almost wrote Lucre instead of Lucas.). He has been seduced by... oops, there I go again.(For a very entertaining, and somewhat harsher, review of this movie, look up the Nov. 21, 2005, 1-star review ""Yikes"" by mptesteroni. It's a most enjoyable piece that rises to real heights of intelligent irate indignation. You may enjoy it more than the film.)",N/A
232465,"Anyone familiar with director John Huston knows he likes stories about desperate people.  On the surface, the viewer may conclude this work is a break from that theme, but not so.  The six main characters are all unhappy souls desperately clinging to anything that resembles normalcy.  The plot?  Major Penderton works constantly in order to repress his homosexuality, while his wife Leonora starts an affair to fill her sexual appetites.  However, their ""marriage"" is put to the test when a young private becomes obsessed with Leonora.  Now then, Huston does his best to assemble a thought-provoking piece that explores dysfunctional relationships.  Unfortunately, the effort fails in its attempt due largely to the odd sub-plot involving the wife and houseboy of Lt. Col. Langdon.  Too much time is spent on this bizarre relationship since too little is gleaned from those scenes.  An audience doesn't need ten minutes or more to recognize crazy.  Indeed, this picture doesn't want to tell a conventional story, but no work should include extraneous elements that do not advance the plot.  ""Reflections In A Golden Eye"" is a loosely knit psychological drama that unwinds well before the third act.COMMENTS:  {SPOILER ALERT}  The ending is particularly disappointing because of the way Huston decides to shoot it.  Major Penderton has just slain Private Williams waking Leonora in the process.  With one continuous shot bouncing between the three characters over and over again, the film goes from a drama to a farce.  Before now, I can only recall observing this see-saw technique in comedies.  After watching this movie however, I think the joke is perhaps on the viewer.",Reflections in a Golden Eye VHS

In the book the idea doesn't really crop up till the end. And no viewer could have any feeling for goody-goody brother Aron nor the irritating Abra - Steinbeck gives a depth and understanding to his characters.The boys' mother Kate, who abandoned them to be a brothel mistress, is a hugely darker person than is shown here. I appreciate that 50s censorship meant mention couldn't be made of what went on in her house of ill repute; but neither do we hear anything of her past - she was 'just a drifter' whom Adam Trask fell for. What about her setting the parental home on fire; her poisoning the former madame ?Of course it's a long book and I understand it needed 'pruning'. Perhaps Lee, the faithful Chinese retainer, who features massively in the book, wouldn't translate to well to film.

The sets are magnificant. And the photography is beautiful. I heard somewhere that it was like watching a painting move. And that is pretty accurate. Kubrick paid very close attention to detail, and it is a very beautiful picture to watch. The problem is that the characters are one dimensional, Lord Bullingdon being the one exception. The acting is wooden. The story moves at such a slow pace. The movie feels like it goes on for hours and hours. It's hard to believe that the same guy who made A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket is the same filmmaker who made this movie. It's just plain boring.

1583574,"I have been watching CSI for seven years. I will still consider it one of my favorite shows of all time. Some fans thought the show was going to go downhill in season 9 when William Peterson left, and surprisingly, it didn't. Laurence Fishburne made a surprisingly good lead, and some of my favorite episodes actually come from season 11 (which also had that awesome cameo from Peterson). So, what happened?Season 12 saw the departure of Fishburne, and Ted Danson came in as the new lead. I thought Danson was a good new addition to the cast, and I will say that season 12 was good, just not as good as season 11. My hope was that season 12 would be just like season 10; a good season, but the show was still trying to find it's footing. Season 10 was good, but it was still awkward without Peterson, and the writing wasn't all that top notch. Season 11, however, really stepped up it's game and did a terrific job utilizing Fishburne as it's lead. I hoped that season 13 would also step up it's game and take more advantage of it's new cast members.Unfortunately, None of the new or old characters are developed. If you didn't care for characters like Finn or Brody, this season doesn't help. They get more screen time, but they aren't developed and you still don't get much backstory from them (they're acting hasn't improved that much either). They come off as more annoying as ever. But, what really killed this season for me, was the episode &#34;Forget me not&#34;, which seriously jumped the shark. If you don't want to be spoiled, then stop reading this review.*SPOILERS!*Sara and Grisom are now divorced. Yep, nine years were spent developing this relationship. Now, it's meaningless. Imagine if &#34;Friends&#34; was renewed for an 11th season, and Rachael decided to go to Paris after all. Talk about a slap in the face to fans of those characters. This was the moment in CSI that they ran out of ideas for drama, and they decided &#34;hey, how about Sara gets divorced?&#34; BRILLIANT! One problem: She's married to one of the most beloved characters on the show, who isn't even here anymore. I know the human drama isn't the focus of the show but... oh wait, yes it is! What made this show stand out was it's characters, and why it's been around for all of these years. I know not every character is going to get a happy ending, but we invested nine years in the relationship of these characters. Splitting up Sara and Grisom made me consider everything post season 12 of CSI is non canon.Like I said, I know other fans will write this off and say &#34;eh, I just watch the show for the crime solving&#34;. But this season, the forensics side of it is pushed too far to the background. The mysteries this season are too predictable and too convoluted (even for CSI standards). The human drama that used to make this show so great is now the equivalent of a bad soap opera. If you're a fan of this show, I'd say just watch up to season 12, then the season 13 premiere, which works as a nice little finale. There really isn't anything worth watching after that. I wasn't one of the fans that gave up on this show after Peterson left. I'm glad I continued to watch, but now, it's time to stop. I'm not going to act like this season is terrible (there are a few mildly entertaining episodes here and there) but it's not the same CSI.",CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Season 13
789340,"This is about what you would expect from the &quot;thriller&quot; formula.  There is the family who moves to the country to get away from the hustle-bustle and the crime, there is the run-down old house they wish to turn into their dream home, and then comes along an ex-con drifter-type who used to live there.  All the ingredients for a predictable film.  Everything you could think of that could happen, does.  There is a house full of snakes, the family pet is slain, and the bad guy falls to his death through a beautiful stained-glass window.  I really didn't give the ending away, because early in the film the children are looking around the house (tresspassing, actually) when we see them open a window and look around a central shaft of the house and on the ground floor ceiling there is the multi-colored, stained-glass window.  Did the filmmakers actually think the audience was going to forget such an obvious scene?  There is also the dark and stormy night by film's end, complete with a battle on the roof.  One of my favorite scenes was when Dennis Quaid is alone in the house and he hears sombody walking toward him and there is a single low note played on the piano for the score.  Doom!  I chuckled heartily at the feeble attempt at making me scared.  Back to the rooftop.  There is the predictable scene when the killer has to give his monologue so that either help can arrive or the victim's-to-be figure out a way to thwart the dastardly dude.  When the couple are being chased through the house, lightning flashing through the windows, Sharon Stone is supposed to look terrified, but instead I thought she needed to use the bathroom. She should try the pink stuff.  She seriously overacts in more than one scene.  Dennis Quaid is passable, but only just.  The only actor worth his salt here is Stephen Dorff.  He does a subtle yet persuasive job given that his character's agenda is so predictable.  Overall, this film is pretty lame stuff.  So far this film is averaging 2 stars and the distributors are trying to sell over 130 copies at this site alone.  That should be warning enough to avoid this film.

It's incredibly hard for me to take a film seriously when Wilt Chamberlain is in it. Anyway, I thought Conan the Destroyer was slightly better than the original because it was shorter, somewhat less boring, and more passable. The acting was not bad, but it wasn't great. The subplots were wafer-thin because when one was initiated, it got dropped later. A good example is the ""ending"". It wasn't an ending at all; just a continuum. Thank goodness, there was no third part. Had Malak (played by Tracey Walter) be cut out of the film entirely, Conan the Destroyer would have had a better rating. He was so despicably annoying and hated. Also, cut Grace Jones please. Cut Wilt Chamberlain. Cut Olivia d'Abo. Man, what a lousy cast. A couple of redeeming qualities about Conan the Destroyer is the custom and set designs. I thought they were very good and deserving of merits. Poor dialogue wrecked havoc on the film as whole.

In fact, I'm not sure there was much of a message--the filmmakers might have intended there to be one, but it's buried in a mix of visual images that are certainly striking, but definitely not cohesive enough to make the message clear.The filmmakers also have decided to focus solely on the grim side of culture, and there are so few smiling faces here that it makes you wonder if two-thirds of the people in the world live each day with grim, depressed looks on their faces.  By using slow motion so much, they tend to pull the dynamic side of life completely out of the picture, and it grows old very quickly.  Where are the playing children?  And as another reviewer said, they left out the abominable side of the third world, such as beatings and executions, and they've also left out the graft and corruption that make it difficult for anyone to help people in these countries.I felt all along that I was being manipulated, forced to watch images of their choice so that my worldview would become what they desired my worldview to be.  As a film, this is much better watched in segments, music piece by music piece, perhaps, as it does grow old after half an hour or so.

Perhaps my expectations were too high going into another British movie, but unfortunately it didn't move me as much as I had hoped. In fact, I fast-forwarded the ending just to get through it.  I so hate giving a two-star review to great artists.  But just because they are, it doesn't make the work itself a great picture.It's a story about a retirement home where aging musicians go to live out the remainder of their lives.  Many of them know each other from the early days when they were at the highlight of their careers.  They have now congregated in one place to continue dabbling in the art of music while they wait for the undertaker to take them away in a body bag.Maggie Smith plays Jean Horton, a once famous and highly sought after opera singer who is now old, broke, and alone.  (Of course they say she's broke, but I'm not sure how she affords the swanky retirement home.)  Like most elderly, her baggage upon arrival is filled with bitterness over life. To make matters worse, she discovers that her ex-husband is living out his days at the retirement home as well.  He's not much better when it comes to forgiveness for Jean's early days of adultery, so most of the movie he has a chip on his shoulder along with the air of being a former star himself.The storyline is weak, superficial, and frankly uninteresting.  I will say this, that it would be a great place to retire! The movie is set in an converted English manor, with gorgeous countryside, comfortable and beautiful interior, kind staff, and an eclectic mix of eccentric elderly. You can sing your days away, rumba to music, croquet to your heart's content, and walk the grounds with a dirty old man, if you'd like. However, the story, at least for me, started with a great premise, but moved at a snail's pace.If the movie accomplishes anything, it does give a poignant view of aging and how one's youth and glory fades. We all know it's coming; perhaps we just don't wish to acknowledge it.Excuse me, while I search the Internet to find a retirement home in the UK that fits the description for retired authors.  I would love to pack my bags and take my own bitterness over life to a swanky retirement home in the English countryside to live out my days.

1160959,"Downfall is supposed to be the prequel to the Dead Space video game that was released prior to the video. There was a series of preview comics that were downloadable off the XBox marketplace that, and I assumed that the movie was going to be a base for the movie. However, this was not the case.Ther movie primarily follows the Chief of Security of the Ishimura, who tries to contain the outbreak of violence and the necromorphs on the mining ship. The sequence follows a predictable path of disbelief, followed by a dug-in resistance. Several scenes are badly handled. Namely, a officer sees his own wife decapitate herself, and reacts as if she dropped a carton of eggs on the carpet. The ending is very dark and in line with the games tone. That was probably the only scene that reminded me of the Dead Space game.Downfall was written and produced by someone who was told the plot of the video game, and maybe saw it played, but had no opportunity to play it themselves, and also had only cliff notes on the backstory. None of the scenes from the movie that appeared in game are remotely similar, and were well done in the video game, so it was disappointing to see them mess with it. None of the weapons of equipment from the game even makes an appearance, though one that does show up prominently, I wish had been in the game.If the movie had had another title, it would've crawled up to 3 stars, as I wasn't a fan of the srtwork, but the name Dead Space raised expectations, which weren't met on almost every front.",Dead Space: Downfall

Someone is murdering people in ways which emulate those of a serial killer who was executed years ago -- ways known only to the police who were on the case. Even though it seems impossible, one detective believes there is a connection not only to the earlier series of murders, but to the exorcism of young Regan McNeill fifteen years prior.LEGION was written and directed by William Peter Blatty from his own novel.

But like most any other film that uses religious phenomena as its basis, it makes little sense in the end -- it's a hodgepodge of weird happenings and biblical nonsense that doesn't add up.  And why does the devil ever do any of the things he does, anyway?  Boredom?  Had a little extra time on his hands?  The only people who find this sort of thing disturbing are the fundamentalists Christians who actually believe it's real.  Oh, there is one very effective scare about two thirds of the way in, wonderfully set up.  But it's a ""make you jump"" moment.

The film then breaks our necks in a jump cut to the most annoying credits ever filmed featuring an amateur demonstrating skillful stunts on a bicycle. Sound exciting?The hero of the film is the cyclist who has a falling out with his brother over EPA standards for the chemical processing plant full of huge vats of acid they have inherited. There are subplots about camping holidays, annoying realtors, a crazed herpetologist (Robert Englund, who intermittently produces a small snake from his pocket and cuddles with it), and the State Department (of course). To add to the malaise there are moronic government agents (led by Casper Van Dien, who sports the worst accent in recent history), and an overly enthusiastic cop who makes Barney Fife look genuinely menacing.Along the way important lessons are learned: first, understand that squirting baby shampoo at a 130 foot long snake which shoots acid out of its mouth will not repel the snake, however, it may eat your shower curtain; and second, remember that when fleeing for your life on a bicycle from a huge snake capable of crawling at 50 miles per hour, it is important to stop to put on your bike helmet and sunglasses before starting to run from the rapidly encroaching menace. These are just two of the helpful pointers you will learn from ""Python"". The ending of the film is extremely predictable from the point where we learn that the protagonist co-owns an acid factory. I'll give you a clue, it involves the game of hide and seek, and the snake is ""it"".The film is about as lame as lame can get: I can't imagine what the sequel must be like. I can't say that I recommend this film exactly, but I will say that if you want a good laugh at the expense of a hapless CGI snake, this might be a good choice.",N/A
170665,"My girlfriend and sister used to get together to watch this show every Friday, but they noticed some problems.  Why must every episode, for instance, break down into emotional hysteria in the final act?  Is it too much to do some location shooting so the show doesn't look so tied to a back lot set?  And how much of Jennifer Love Hewitt's cleavage must they display in every episode?The show plainly aims for a primarily female audience.  Girl-bonding and loving-hubby themes are mainstays of the structure.  But it also tries to drum up suspense and horror.  I won't say the two can't go together, but the pattern is distinctly repetitive.  Nearly every episode begins with Hewitt's character, Melinda Gordon, trembling in fear of some gruesome spirit; nearly every episode ends with Gordon in tears of mourning as she explains to the spirit why crossing over isn't so bad.Perhaps the mainly male production team thinks that teary-eyed protestations of limp theology will reach a girly audience.  And perhaps they're right, since the show has a large loyal following.  But women I trust, like my sister and my girlfriend, assure me that when the show piles on the same structure week after week, it taxes their ability to take the emotions seriously.Though the show aims for a mainly female audience, it never misses a chance to render good-looking women like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Aisha Tyler as eye candy.  I suspect the creative team thinks men will watch more if there's a hint of skin.  And I can't deny that my girlfriend is sick of me hitting the rewind button every time Sigourney Weaver strips to her skivvies in ""Alien.""  But men need that eye candy in a story we can get behind, not one that peters out in favor of a weepy sermon just when things are getting good.This show's spirit world is especially weak tea.  We hear a lot about the light and, in a handful of episodes, about the dark, but they are never defined.  Whenever Melinda Gordon is pressed on this question, she finks.  My suspicion is that the creative team wants to avoid offending any particular religion.  They accomplish this task by addressing none of them.  Considering that this question comes up in nearly every episode, I find a ""ho-hum"" coming on every time we approach the final act.This series is very loosely based on the work of spiritists James Van Praagh and Mary Ann Wintkowski, both of whom are interviewed in the special features of this DVD collection.  Don't watch them.  It's amazing how they can discuss something as potentially mind-blowing as talking with the spirits of the dead, and still come across as uninteresting wet rags.I know many people enjoy this show, and I don't want to take anything from them.  If this is your taste, bless your heart.  But when I deal with such potentially meaty subjects, I don't want my story to wimp in the clutch.  I look forward to a show which addresses questions like these without giving up its teeth.  This show just doesn't meet my needs.",N/A

947933,"UPDATE ADDED FEB 23rd 2006:Whoa clearly I offended some KsE fans with my review... So in my defense I will set the record straight. [I just watched the concert again last weekend.]1) There is Overdubs..... And they aren't used that sparingly .  [Also I did NOT claim they played with audio I simply stated they `dressed' up the `live' sound in the Studio.]2) We are not here to review their live performance at their actual shows... we are here to review the Product in question. (Which is a DVD)  I have no doubt they would put on a good live show... I can see it for a fact... they are energetic with a good stage presence.  But this doesn't change that the DVD was OVERDUBBED!3) This is a review column and I am entitled to my opinion whether it be, 1,2,3,4 or 5 stars as long as you give a reason to back your rating...  I clearly explained why I gave it 2.5 (Which I always round down, see my other reviews for proof of half-stars...) - It's not like I said it sucks and gave it one star.Below is my original review posted Feb 6th 2006.________________________________________KILLSWITCH ENGAGE - Set This World Ablaze.-Some of my close friends are big fans of KsE so when they got the DVD - It came over to my house...Personally I never really got into their Powerful Boy-Band Choruses but also had tons of respect for Adam D. and the bands general musicianship.  Now that being said I did watch the concert...Is it enjoyable?  Yes.  Is it over-dubbed?  Hell Yes.I mean as cool as it is to be in a cape and running around on stage in your boxers...  If you need to overdub the music is it really worth the show?I just feel they've crossed the line from artists to entertainers.  Puppets of the `New Wave of American Metal' Scene... Also I'm really not trying to be rude but the reason everyone says:""This is the best Live DVD I've ever seen!!!""Are saying this because it isn't really `LIVE' - They used Overdubs!!!  Sometimes minimal overdubs are done live to fix a minor error... (Pantera's Live CD contained minimal overdubs if any.... Also Opeths Live DVD - LAMENATIONS contained ZERO overdubs.)  But they shouldn't be produced to the point of a studio album... (Must be nice to have Roadrunner Records funding full-scale studio production of a Live Recording...)Also just because I'm being picky, Howard Jones has a really weak 'Live' voice.... There I said it. I'm sorry but it's true.Overall I would recommend it for fans of KsE... It is, at least entertaining... and bonus footage is decent.The best I could give it was-2.5 Stars[Kids, as much as I have respect for Adam D. there are much better bands then KsE.  For similar, but better, NWoAHM bands check out: Unearth, Lamb of God, All that Remains, Trivium or even God Forbid's Newest album. For some more unique bands that blend Metal with actual singing try: Opeth, Between the Buried and Me,or Into Eternity.]IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?""",N/A
367986,"*** This review contains spoilers ***The bulk of 'Belle Epoque' is supposed to be a pastoral romance, a farce of sorts despite being set during the heady eve of the Spanish Civil War in 1931. The film begins inappropriately with our protagonist, Fernando, an army deserter, having just been taken into custody by two officers of the Civil Guard who happen to be father and son-in-law. The father-in-law wants to let Fernando go but the son-in-law, a Nationalist, can't stomach the idea of allowing a 'traitor' to walk free so impulsively he shoots his father-in-law to death but realizing he'll have to face his wife later on and tell her that he's responsible for killing her father, ends up killing himself. Not a very good idea to start off with such an unpleasant scene when most of your story is supposed to be comic in tone.Fernando arrives in a village and seeks to patronize a prostitute at the local brothel. We find out the local priest has no guilt feelings about playing cards with his buddies inside the brothel. There, Fernando meets one of the priest's fellow card players, Manolo, a retired artist, who invites him to stay at his house. Like most people in the village, Manolo is decidedly pro-Republican and is thoroughly tolerant of alternative lifestyles. Fernando is about to return to Madrid but changes his mind when Manolo's four daughters arrive by train.Since this is a farce, we're supposed to suspend our disbelief when each of the four daughters falls for the rather passive Fernando with the libertine Manolo encouraging the randy Lothario as he beds each woman.One of the daughters, Violeta, is an independent woman who works as a veterinarian and also happens to be a lesbian. When the daughters dress Fernando up as a maid for a costume party at a local carnival, Violeta dresses herself up in Fernando's army uniform and then ends up having sex with him inside a barn at the carnival. In a scene more titillating than erotic, Fernando passively lies underneath in his maid's costume as Violeta makes love to him on top. The next day, Fernando informs Manolo of the encounter and he's overjoyed that his daughter now has shown an interest in men. Violeta squelches any possibilities that she has an interest in the opposite sex and makes it clear to her father that in effect the previous night's encounter was simply 'role-playing' and she really has no interest in Fernando.Despite her great attraction to Fernando, Rocio, another one of Manolo's daughters, has been involved with Juanito, a son of a wealthy Royalist widow, who has difficulty escaping the clutches of his control freak mother. There are some rather unfunny scenes with the mother going after Rocio and Juanito even goes so far as to demand that he be excommunicated from the church by the local priest in order to prove to Rocio he's no longer a mamma's boy. At the same time, Rocio strings Juanito along but eventually realizes that they were made for each other and end up marrying.Fernando also tries to prove his mettle with Clara, who lost her husband a year before in a drowning accident. The film's scenarists try to extract some humor in a reference to the deceased husband's last meal. Clara mentions that he loved rice and her sister states it was the only dish he knew how to cook. Clara then lamely replies, ""I know"". Clara becomes so confused over her feelings for Fernando, that she ends up pushing him into the river, in the same spot where her ex-husband drowned. Fernando contracts pneumonia and the daughters then have to attend to him to ensure that he recovers.The last daughter, Luz (played by Penelope Cruz), is perhaps the least interesting of the four daughters. She's simply childish and is jealous of her three sisters who have already become involved with Fernando. I'm not sure exactly why Fernando ends up with Luz (perhaps he feels sorry for her) but the young couple are seen leaving for America at film's end.In addition to the sour note of the murder/suicide at the start of the film, there's also another unsavory moment when the priest kills himself after he feels betrayed by his hero, poet/philosopher Miguel de Unamono, who for a short while supported Franco and the Nationalists.Belle Epoque fails not only for its two brief unnecessary forays into tragedy (the death of the Civil Guards and the Priest suicide) but because the principal characters are decidedly superficial and hence inconsequential. Violeta is basically mean-spirited (recall her unchivalrous tirade after Fernando informs her father of their fling); Rocio is a shallow coquette in regards to her relationship with Juanito, the foolish Clara is disconnected, unable to truly grieve over her lost husband and Luz is simply an immature adolescent. As for Fernando, his behavior with the four daughters speaks for itself!Only Manolo, the intuitive libertine, comes across as somewhat multi-dimensional character. He's seen as particularly likable when he's willing to accept his opera singer wife's manager who he's quite aware has been involved with her while they've been on tour. Manolo is also a philosopher--I particularly liked when he reads a sensual passage from the 'The Magic Mountain' and concludes with the line: ""What youth!"".As a point of comparison, there's a British/Irish film made in 2000 entitled 'About Adam' which has a very similar storyline to Belle Epoque. A young Lothario ingratiates his way into a household consisting mainly of women who have become besotted with him. Both are farcical in tone but 'Adam' manages to exude a slight bit more charm than the specious 'Epoque'.'Belle' is the perfect kind of mediocre film which you would expect would win an Oscar for Best Foreign Language feature. It was safe and offended no one which guaranteed all the awards and accolades it managed to garner.",N/A

915609,"I wonder if there is even one film actress who has not been offered the role of a prostitute.  Critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel once mused the reason so many movies include call girl characters is that is the only kind of woman the men who run Hollywood know.Of course, in movies prostitution almost always seems to be a transaction between consenting adults.  As with the smash PRETTY WOMAN, the Dan Aykroyd farce DOCTOR DETROIT makes being a call girl appear as likely a career choice as accounting or teaching.  I don't hear any female high school graduates saying, ""I'm gonna be a hooker - I really wanted to be a tax accountant but that requires college and I want to start earning now!""A 1983 comedy, DOCTOR DETROIT presents an innocuous college professor who gets mixed up in an organized crime power struggle involving prostitution and other illegal activity.  Thanks to a capable cast including Aykroyd, Fran Drescher,  T.K. Carter, Howard Hesseman, Andrew Duggan, and George Furth, the action is once in a while humorous, with uninteresting parts that at least never go on to the point where you give up on the film.Some of DOCTOR DETROIT's best moments belong to Lydia Lei, who, according to the INTERNATIONAL MOVIES DATABASE web site, was about halfway through a decade-long movie & television acting career when she made this title.  Lei's an energetic presence in her portrayal of Jasmine, one of the call girls who helps Aykroyd get in and out of his fine mess.  It is unfortunate her talents may not have been used this well elsewhere.  (I saw Lydia Lei in one other movie, the bomb thriller VICE SQUAD, where she again plays a girl for hire.)What DOCTOR DETROIT needs most is a more engaging villain.  Actress Kate Murtagh does her best as mob boss Mom but except for menacing people and having her goons chase around Aykroyd every so often, she does not get to do enough to make you root against her.DOCTOR DETROIT's funny at times but disappointing at too many other times.",Doctor Detroit
1173755,"I knew I was in trouble when, within 15 minutes of this film starting, I had to deal with another 'John Favreau-Swingers' type of character.  That means that we get to spend an hour and forty five minutes watching a whiny 30 year old guy mope around because his girlfriend dumped him.This would be tolerable for a high school kid, but not a 30 year old guy who they show throughout the film as being almost a 3rd wheel at his gf's premiers and red carpet events.  he doesn't like any of the clothes she buys him, either...so you never really know why he is so devastated with the breakup to begin with.  The more they flashed back to their past the more you realize what a nightmare she is....so I don't get it.But anyway, this guy decides the best way to clear his head is to go to Hawaii.  Of course, his ex is at the same hotel on the same island with her new man.  Basically, it's the same plot as any other 'comedy' about breakups and how people try to get over failed relationships.  I guess this is the structure for Comedy 101, but the filmmakers and writers here are better than that, so the entire premise is disappointing.It's way too easy to figure out what's going to happen when he checks into the hotel, has the awkward moment with his ex and...SHOCK...there's a beautiful brunette who just happens to work at the reception desk.Since everyone is comparing this to 'Knocked Up'...there is no comparison.  Everything about 'Knocked Up' was completely original and had the type of dialogue that you just didn't/don't get in American cinema.  The only thing close to it was 'There's Something About Mary'.I understand it's hard to live up to that kind of standard and virtually everything they do from here on out will be a bit of a disappointment.  However, this really was a major disappointment.  I 'chuckled' three times at three lines that may have taken up a combined :17 of film time...and when you're dealing with an hour and forty five minutes of film time, that's a lot of dead air.I think we'd be better in comparing it to another movie....Ben Stiller's 'The Heartbreak Kid' that was equally as bad.  That's a much better comparison.Hopefully I click my Kangaroo's together and wake up from the nightmare that was viewing this feature film.Just say no.",N/A
1366031,"poor intro to the story using a narrative and the ending was likewise a disappointment. I believe we have the director to blame for some of the failure in this movie such as having Jeff Bridges over do trying to sound gruff. In the middle of the movie where a little more of his natural voice was allowed, it was actually an improvement to the experience of the movie. The gal that plays Mattie had some bright spots with her expressions, but the haggling scene came up short in comparison to the original. I'm not a huge John Wayne fan, BUT when he did something right.....he flat did it extremely well and the same goes for Duvall and the rest of the cast of characters in the original. Matt Damon started out well but then was no better than Glenn Campbell and lacked in his performance.I blame the director for the shortcomings in this movie. Sure Barry Pepper is a great actor, but he just didn't carry the role as well as Duvall. Josh Brolin was ok, but again kept from doing it as well as he could. It was obvious. It was as if all the actors were being held back from giving their best to follow the vision of the director who should stick to Sci-fi etc and forget about remaking a great classic western that was done so perfectly the first time around. I honestly don't know what the director was thinking. I live out west and the characters lacked the flavor, the spice and character of real life out here.John Wayne's True Grit captured all of it.My wife was also greatly disappointed in this film, so much so that she demanded I get the original along with Rooster Cogburn in case some fool decided to do a remake and screw that up as well.You expect more, you expect better, not in special effects, but in content and performance. The 1st True Grit is a 5 star plus film. This film was a sad disappointment and I'm glad I bought it cheap.",True Grit
1130174,"This movie is a sloppy and rather pointless remake that curiously doesn't have much to do with Romero's original, which though flawed, is more entertaining than this. There are a lot of small details that will annoy the zombie/horror fan here. On their own, they don't matter much, but add them together and you have a very disappointing film.The acting? I didn't think it was too bad, actually. Mena Suvari and Ving Rhames, although uninspired,  add weight and authority to the story, but unfortunately, they decide to knock off Rhames early in the film and it goes downhill from there.The zombies? Crucial to a movie like this, of course. The virus storyline is never explored, just mentioned in passing. The zombies actually manage to be even more energetic and athletic than in the previous (and excellent) Dawn of the Dead remake, which is a feat in itself. They run, jump, climb on the ceiling (seriously), snarl, growl, and flail around like spastics with seizures pretty much non-stop. The transformation from infected normal human being to half-rotten zombie with the skin falling off literally takes place in the blink of an eye.The FX? Generally decent with some really bad CGI thrown in there.The story? There isn't much of one. Like I said, the virus aspect is briefly mentioned and then ignored. After that, it's business as usual. Running around, lots of screaming, people being killed, OMG What are we going to do, argh, splat, urgh.The bottom line? Cheap, sloppy, and rushed. A wasted opportunity.",N/A

I never saw the original or its sequels, fearing the films would be loaded with gratutitous violence for no good purpose other than bloodletting. This one sure is.I realize there was really a Buford Pusser and he set out to clean up the debauchery and degradation of a small town. However, that is no justification for what goes on in this film.Our ""hero"", The Rock (AKA Darrell Johnson who admitted to using liposuction as part of his process to get a great build) comes home and is almost immediately put off by the debauchery and drug dealing going on in his community.He tries to affect this and gets beat up for it. When he recovers he commits about 20 felonies, then goes on trial, saying he did it for revenge, and if the townsfolk on the jury would acquit him he'd run for sheriff and clean up the despicable place.Guess what? They acquit him! Then he commits more felonies in the name of the sheriff -- with his ridiculous deputy helping out -- by denying an arrestee either a phone call or legal representation and tearing apart his personal property in a so-called ""search"" for drugs.This is followed by the beauty going over to his side and the bad guys attacking him with automatic weapons.

Polly, for instance, tried suicide because she (gasp) let herself eat two pieces of pizza.  Shelly was on so many pills she probably should have also gone into detox.  The one that affected me the most was 15-year old Brittany, who literally wanted to die rather than get fat.  The fact that her own mother was her enabler (she, too, suffers from an eating disorder) made me all the madder.  Watch for the part where Brittany tells about her and her mother's ""chew and spit"" cycle of eating, and then cringe when you hear her sob at the end when she tells another patient that she ""misses being up at 2:00 a.m. changing her clothes all the time, and at least if she dies, she'll die thin.""I think that all these women have suffered some type of major trauma in their lives, but that was never touched on.  Shelly and Alisa seem to have some kind of monsters they are running from, but you'll never know what those monsters are.  I do not know if eating disorders are considered a mental illness.  If not, they should be.  However, these eating disorders remind me of ANY addiction:  if these women refuse to admit they have a problem, no one can help them.  There is no wonderful ending to this documentary.  The outcomes are mostly stark and offer no resolution.",Thin

You may be able to learn what not to do to make a film. Try to figure just WHY this film is bad instead of taking it for granted. After watching you should look into the history of how this film came to be. It's actually an interesting story. Case in point: If you are making a movie about a ""Robot Monster"" but don't have the budget for a ""Robot"" costume, you should probably realize that you should not even start production instead of using your friend's gorilla suit that he happens to have.

A view of the 60's counterculture that didn't even ring true then.  I also seem to recall that when I saw this in the 60's that Susan Clark points out the actual Coogan's Bluff (a real natural landmark in NY) to Eastwood's character during their scene above the Cloisters.  She tells a little story about it, tying it to the character's ""bluff"" about how tough he is.  If I am recalling correctly, that scene has been clumsily trimmed out on this DVD.  Note how in one shot Eastwood is wearing his hat, but in the very next one it is off.  At that point the dialogue appears to jump from one subject to an entirely different one.

Further, Catholicism is depicted as the religion for those who suffer from a massive and morbid guilt complex - surely this was not the main theme of the book?

176008,"This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's ""hippie mentality"" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. A naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( Kay Lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in ""love"" with him. If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she ""loves"" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. I couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. Its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. A corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film.

1459924,"When I was a kid, I thought these two movies were really cool. It was around the time the Marvel had made deals with CBS to bring Characters like Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Doctor Strange to TV. You would think that they were going to be as well written and produced as the Hulk was, but alas, Captain America was not.The story was set in the late 1970's instead and used the idea that Steve Rogers had just gotten out of the Marines and was called in by a scientist that had worked with Steve's Father on a Steroid called F.L.A.G (Full Latent Ability Gain). The Steroid worked to increase the stregth of the person or animal ifused with it, but killed them in the end. The only one that could take it was Steve, because it was from his Father. His Father apparently was the 1st Captain America.Ok, This verges off from what the actual origon of the cahracter is. We don't even get a good looking sheild in this. It's a Bulletproof Glass that looks terrible. He can throw it like a boomarang, but it looks really fake. The only cool part was the bike he rode. The story is fractured. The villian in the 1st film know that if Steve gets the FLAG steoid, that he would be able to do things that only a perfect human could do. How did the villian find out about FLAG? We don't even get a suit that resembles the comic suit until the tale end of the first one. It looks really poor.

Who filled the missing persons report between the movies? Isn't it a little convienient that Sarah suffered enough stress she doesn't remember what happened? Why bring her back so soon after you found her? Why are you entering the cave's from a totally different enterance? And why have only six people investagate?After that the movie becomes almost like the first one and it got better, good scares, good deaths, good continutity with the first movie and a nice twist. However, the characters aren't nearly as interesting this time and you are more likly to want to see them dead. Another gripe is that one character's behavior just seems unnatural, he appears calm at the start but quickly develops a sense of paranoia that really annoyed me.Then the ending, completly sucked. It felt stupid and was just there so another potential sequel could be possible.

636479,"Kate Hudson stars as a caring and sweet twenty-something nursing home assistant down in New Orleans who has had enough of retirement homes and despises how their staff and management mistreats the elderly. The general indifference towards the old, dying and dead seniors is unforgivable and intolerable, so she quits, packs her bags and seeks a more nurturing and rewarding job because her previous occupation was taking its toll on her general well being.She ends up finding a job as a care taker of an older southern gentleman, being hired by his wife, both of whom live in an old plantation mansion situated way out in the middle of a remote swamp on the outskirts of New Orleans. The caretaker's best friend questions the wisdom of this move, foreshadowing unexpected things to come. Nevertheless, she accepts the job, anxious to get away from the apathy of the big city life and looks forward to truly helping a person in need. Her wish is fulfilled, but not in the way she was hoping for. She's introduced to the manager of the estate who sets up the job interview and subsequent hiring, after he seemingly convinces the older gentleman's wife to accept the young girl to live and care for her stroke-affected husband.As her journey from the urban to rural life progresses, the audience is introduced to a rich and vibrant cajun culture, full with Hoodoo and Voodoo, not to be confused with one another. The experience for her is a bit of a culture shock to say the least, but she finds it intriguing and it fuels her desire to learn more and adapt to her newfound circumstances. What follows however isn't quite as enriching of an experience as she wanted but rather she is confronted with not only age old superstitions but also their very real impact on the people entrenched within the inherent customs and beliefs.After working for awhile in the house and getting to know the tenants a little better, exploring the house and its history, she finds herself immersed in a swamp of mystery that promises to never let her go back to her old life in more ways than one.Without revealing too much, the movie had an interesting premise with strong performances from the entire cast, not to mention the setting which is a character all by itself, but the entertainment factor of the film was lost in translation from its inability to decide whether it was a real or fictional story, and that's where the magic was debunked by its own doing. The film never had the makings of greatness but it could have ended up being a decent film had it stuck with its original direction of where the story was headed. Surprising twists can make a break a film, and in this case it was the latter. It's a shame that the indirect magic of watching the film was disspelled by its supernatural hoodoo.It might please some fans of thrillers and the supernatural, but it's barely worth watching once.",N/A

1311341,"All of the trailers and TV spots have given people the idea that The Expendables  unites as many of the biggest action film stars in one film and promises to be one of the bloodiest and explosive films in recent memory. So to expect strong writing or a coherent story in a film like this would just be absurd, so I thought that expecting an entertaining action film and nothing more would fit the mold perfectly. Somehow the film still managed to be an out of control mess.The writing was cringe-worthy. It felt like we were thrown into a film that had already established a back story, but maybe that's what they were going for since most of these actors have action films that they're associated with. The dialogue will probably make you groan at how corny it is at times. If Mickey Rourke's speech about putting a Charlotte's Web tattoo on Jason Statham's ""perfect, round head"" wasn't improvised, then that is really disappointing as Rourke seemed to struggle on spitting the words out during that scene. The Expendables certainly felt like it filmed all the big action sequences first and then tried to throw together a script and a story at the last minute. One of the most humorous aspects of the film was the fact that it had to make a big deal about Steve Austin's character not having any objections to roughing up women when he was accused of abusing them in real life.With this many stars in the film, you can probably guess that it isn't very well balanced. Getting all of these action stars in one film is certainly an achievement, but most of them don't have much screen time. The first half of the film seems to be very Jason Statham heavy while the rest of the film is mostly Stallone. Jet Li and Mickey Rourke have a few scenes where they stick out while Dolph Lundgren seems to sit on the sidelines for most of the film. If you're going into this film expecting a larger role from someone who isn't in this paragraph, then you'll probably be disappointed due to how small their role really is.The film is capable of delivering some bone-crunching and blood soaked fight sequences in addition to an incredible amount of explosions that would even make Michael Bay contemplate whether or not he's had this much destruction in one film. Some of the ways that people die in the film are gloriously gruesome while the film shines brightest during the scenes where Barney's team is too busy fighting to say much of anything. Most of the action scenes in Vilena, the car chase that ends with the fight between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren, and the finale of the film are all deliciously explosive, fast paced, and hit hard enough to satisfy most action film fans.The Expendables is poorly written and rather brainless, but is capable of giving its audience exactly what it advertised and that's deliver one of the loudest action films ever that features quite possibly the greatest gathering of action stars in any film. If you're somehow able to ignore the disconnected storyline and stupefyingly simple dialogue, then you'll probably be able to enjoy the clutter of explosive and fast paced action.",N/A

1259143,"First, the good news: In Merlin and the Book of Beasts, Merlin does indeed make an appearance, as does the aforementioned book.Now for the bad news.  Merlin (James Callis) adopts a thickly accented Welsh dialect that is as irritating as it is undecipherable. Fans of Battlestar Galactica who are familiar with Callis' pleasant inflection will find no solace here. It seems Callis wanted to take on an eccentric role, and he does so with gusto.The Book of Beasts isn't precisely the Monster Manual one might expect from a fantasy-themed movie. It starts with killer butterflies (ooh, scary!), moves to ""dragon knights"" which are basically giant zombies, some giant birds that are only heard off-screen (maybe they're griffons?), and then there's the Gorgons.What?  You thought this was a movie about medieval times?  Well you can forget it, because The Book of Beasts is one sandal away from Clash of the Titans.  The Gorgons themselves are here in all their glory; beautiful until angered, whereupon they turn into snake-haired harpies.  The Arkadian who summons them (Jim Thorburn) has a dark secret, but mostly he runs out of ideas and decides to stick with his highest-level monster.So the Gorgons take up most of the movie, more than the archvillain himself. Throughout the film is another plot about how Sir Galahad (Donald Adams) is leading the return of the next generation of knights, including King Arthur's progeny Avlynn (Laura Harris). But really this is about Gorgons turning people into statues, seducing men, and hissing a lot.Book of Beasts aims high and fails to achieve its lofty goal as a sort of sequel to the Arthurian myth. The special effects are used wisely to portray the monsters, but there simply isn't enough variety to make for much of a book.",Merlin & The Book Of Beasts

Perhaps there is a coherent and entertaining film buried in there somewhere, but as it stands now, what we have is two hours of incoherence.  The switching between talking heads and a dramatic story featuring Marlee Matlin does not work.  Rather than complement one another, the film's two ""halves"" serve only to confuse and muddle the proceedings.  I found the Marlee Matlin scenes totally unnecessary - they neither enhanced the talking points nor were particularly entertaining.  The interviews were the most interesting aspect of the film, but the clips are too brief to be of much use.  Quantum physics is not something you can describe adequately in a one-minute sound bite.A better approach would have been to keep the special effects (not bad) and include longer interview segments with the so-called experts (minus the Ramtha lady, whose presence delegitimizes the entire film).  Get rid of the Marlee Matlin segments, as well.  Maybe what you're left with is something resembling a show on the Discovery Channel or NOVA, but at least it would be coherent.",N/A

Xander dumps Anya in a roomfull of her friends (many of who are vengence demons) and not one of them does anything about it.

1580232,"I must preface by saying that I like Kung Fu movies -- and I've seen my share of them. The Man with the Iron Fists has the body of a new style Chinese Martial Arts film like House of the Flying Daggers, the brains of Enter the Dragon, and the soul of Machete -- although it's not nearly as much fun as Robert Rodriquez's similar riff on the Mexican Gangster film. Fists isn't really a Chinese film at all, although plenty of the talent is from the Middle Kingdom, but instead is a re-envisioned fantasy of the Kung Fu genre through the eyes of Wu-Tang mastermind and rapper RZA. He wrote, directed, and starred.There's a lot to like in this film (as a Kung Fu fan). The characters are pretty memorable in a comic book, kung fu, video game kind of way. They each have their own weapons, powers, and gimmicks. A few of them are even well acted (or over acted) like Russell Crowe's entertaining performance as Jack Knife or Lucy Liu as Black Widow. Many have bad hair.RZA and his titular character forms the weakest link. He's just flat. His voice over is hard to understand and the rapper voice narrating Kung Fu feels totally out of place. But his music's good. And despite some nearly incoherent editing and minimal storytelling, the overall style is pretty decent.The villains are pretty darn cheesy, particularly the heavy metal fright wig hair styles of the Lion Clan, but whatever, it's a campy almost spoof of the Kung Fu genre. It's gory as hell too, but despite numerous brothel scenes, strangely chaste (no nudity at all). Hmmm, there's that weird violence is better than sex thing. What gives? A big chunk of backstory on RZA's character shoved into the middle of the film is a total snooze-a-rama, but other than  that, the action scenes are exciting and the brothel scenes funny, so if you like the genre, go for it.

It was way too much destruction that took up much of the movie.

One would think that with the cast the producers had assembled, this film would be one of those movies which plays on the comic ironies of life.  It isn't.  The supporting characters are fairly one dimensional, only there to provide situations for Molly Shannon to play off of, so its hard to feel any real involvement or interest in them.  Perhaps thats why the cover of the DVD only shows Molly and her dog as an actual picture, while the rest of the cast are only line drawings.  The ending was peculiar, with Peggy (Molly Shannon)apparently deciding to devote her life to the welfare of animals rather than evolving into someone who could move comfortably in both worlds (people and animals).  You could term this a ""throw away movie"", as there is little about the film to encourage one to watch it again.  With Molly Shannon, I was expecting a funny script, but instead I sat through the film wondering where it was going.  Its a sad day when I felt more humanity in films like ""Never Been Kissed"" and ""Assault of the Killer Bimbos"" than I did in this one.

The same scare tactics, the same visual effects, even the same actors! Megumi Okina, who played in main character in Ju-on, portrays the ghostly character in this film. Except for a few, very minor twists, anyone who's seen The Ring, The Grudge, One Missed Call, etc.. can see what's coming a mile away. Not to stay that the overall story or plot is actually bad, but as far as originality goes, this film doesn't even really come close. The acting, which isn't amazing, isn't horrible either. However, I gotta say that Joshua Jackson performances can just be plain boring or lethargic at times. In closing, this film might be a hit with someone who's new to this kind of genre, and who knows, if this movie had been made before a few of these other Asian horror flicks were made, I might be a bit impressed, cause again, this isn't bad of a film.

37521,"With any sequel it's difficult to have high hopes of it surpassing the original.  This rudimentary slasher flick offers nothing new, but it's difficult to say that it's a bad movie.  The story has Jesse (Patton) move in with his family to the house where Nancy from the first movie lived and watched her boyfriend get murdered across the street.  Soon he realises that his sickening nightmares are actually a manifestation of the very thing Nancy was trying to get away from - Freddy Krueger, a deformed monster who possesses Jesse in order to reak bloody havoc.  Caught up in the mess is occassional love interest Lisa (Myers).There's clearly plenty to pick out of the plot, in particular some cheesy acting and plenty of obvious turning points.  However, the gore is laid on thick, with some impressive special effects, especially for a movie made in the 80's.  There's a handful of pretty enjoyable scenes as Freddy rips his way through the pool party of a bunch of obnoxious teens.  The movie is also peppered with gay undertones, although the movie never really tells us why.  In addition, the split-personality of Jesse is never quite exploited for all its worth.  Still, there's a bizarre and appropriately surreal dream sequence at the beginning, and even if this will never truly scare it's still entertaining enough.",N/A

537483,"I saw this film at a mall theatre in the philippines which is most fiting because that country was raped and pillaged by the japanese in the war. Not that historical accuracy means anything in this movie. &quot;Pearl harbor&quot; represents commericalism at it's very worst. Nothing wrong with making a buck but this movie was made and edited in such a way to not offend anybody and great art almost always offends somebody. They didn't want the film to be too patriotic so it wouldn't turn off non americans. They didn't want to portray the japanese too harshly because they wanted the movie to sell there. There had to be a really stupid sappy love story to appeal to the teeny bobbers the way titanic did. So much effort was placed in this movie to appeal the the maximum number of people that nothing is left of redeeming value. Why bother to watch a movie about this most important historical event that cares little for history or patriotism? But they did manage to offend some people. Veterans of world war two and most veteran groups find this film offensive and many recommend that the movie be boycotted. I agree.Now even a misguided movie like this can provide some entertainment. Mississippi burning was a similarly misguided movie but it had some value because of the classic good v evil story line and a great performance by gene hackman. That's not the case here. Both leading men are terribly unconvincing and ben affleck's rafe(rafe?) was comletely dull. Kate beckinsale gives the best performance considering how shallow her character is written. Fact is the writing for the whole film is pathetic. The love story is dumber than dumb as beckinsale's squeeze rafe, gets shot down in europe and is presumed dead. Naturally ben's best buddy(played by josh hannah) moves in and knocks up beckinsdale just before our hunky leading man shows up not so dead after all. And we're supposed to care? Don't worry though because this moronic love story only consumes 2 hours of the movie. That's all.Then we get to that little incidental event of the japanese attack. The action portrayed isn't bad and you can't help but be relieved to see the story move in another direction. Our two studly heros forget about their tense romantic conflict just long enough to hop in a couple of planes and kick some butt while beckinsale and her babe nurse cohorts save lives below. It's all so exciting. When the dust clears 3000 americans are dead but you won't be moved because of the plastic video game presentation.Now apparently mr. bay et al fiqured the movie was lacking at this point so they decided on depicting dolittle's raid on tokyo. Dolittle is depicted by that great patriot himself alec baldwin whose performance isn't too bad. Again history is a little fuzzy here but it provides our heroic leading men an opportunity to be, well, heroic. Unfortunately the josh harnett character doesn't survive the attack and we are supposed to feel sad. Don't worry you won't. Great movies make you feel something. The only thing you will feel from watching this movie is that you wish you didn't waste your hard earned money on it. Titanic was the main blue print for this film. Take a love story and entwine it with a real life tragedy. Titanic suceeded because there were some real gut wrenching moments. Not in &quot;pearl harbor&quot;. As for beckindale and afflecks romance? Well they get back together of course. And Ben, rafe,(rafe?) agrees to raise his buddy's kid. Why should anyone care?Finally there is one good thing about this film. The music is great and the faith hill theme song is quite good......................socks",N/A

I put in Grace Under Pressure next and it is more bright than the original release on VHS...another real disappointment.  The only concert that I can somewhat tolerate, and I emphasize tolerate, is A Show Of Hands, but even that suffers.  I am afraid that in this day and age with HDTV's and modern concerts being filmed with the best equipment makes it tough on these old films.  But, keeping that in mind I feel the companies like Mercury and even Rush should realize that it is up to them to strive to make their older product somehow comparable to today's standards.  These concerts really needed some major restoration work done to them in terms of lighting and color saturation, etc.  I think the sound is ok and the tour book reprints are great.  Those couple things and the Grace Under Pressure CD are what keeps my rating from being one star.I am glad that I only paid $20.99 for this set as it was worth not more than that I am afraid.I think all involved should be ashamed of this package.

424298,"""Wonder Bar"" is a place where nothing ever happens.If you recall that was the tagline for the 1932 best picture Oscar winner ""Grand Hotel"", that's the movie where Greta Garbo wants to be alone.""Wonder Bar"" was a movie that tried to be another ""Grand Hotel"" only it is a major disappointment.The film deals with very serious issues including suicide and premartial sex.Like the 1932 film, ""Wonder Bar"" has its own all-star cast headed by Al Jolson (Al Wonder), Kay Francis (Liana Renaud), Dolores Del Rio (Inez), Dick Powell (Tommy), Guy Kibbee (Henry Simpson), and Hugh Herbert (Corey Pratt).The story goes something like this (try to keep up!) Al is the owner of a very sought after club ""Wonder Bar"", he is also in love with Inez (Del Rio), but Inez loves Harry (Ricardo Cortez). Now we have Tommy (Powell) who works at the club, he too loves Inez, in fact, the two were an item before. Meanwhile Liane Renaud (Francis) is cheating on her husband with Harry! Henry Simpson (Kibbee) and Pratt (Herbert) have decided to take their wives to the club, but the two men keep flirting with much younger women. And finally there's Capt. Hugo Von Ferring, who has lost all of his money to the stock market, and has decided to do away with himself.Now think, all of these stories aregoing on and it's all done to music! That was one fo the film's big mistakes.I know what a lot of you are thinking. So what if a musical takes on serious subjects, just look at opera. And you are right, but, the difference is in opera the songs serve a purpose. They justify the characters feeling. In ""Wonder Bar"" the songs take away from the plot. They are two seperate things.In ""Grand Hotel"" many of the same issues were dealth with, but, ""Hotel"" succeeds because it knew how to deal with its material.The material in ""Wonder Bar"" cries out for drama. It is meant to be taken serious, but for some reason it was decided to go against the overtone of the material and turn it into a musical.What does work in the film's favor is the suprising frankness of the script. Issues are dealth with head on. We know the captain wants to committ suicide. We know Liane has been cheating on her husband. We know what Kibbee and Herbert are up to. And in a turn of event that really surprised me Kibbee and Herbert's wives fo not take this lying down. They flirt with men as well, both wanting to achieve the same things.I always thought the production code went into effect in 1933, but, I guess I was wrong, because I don't see how any of this could have gotten past.""Wonder Bar"" also has a disappointing ending. There doesn't seem to be a sense of a real ""conclusion"". We can't believe the actions some of these characters make. There are also missed comedic opportunities dealing with the Kibbee story-line.Both Kibbee and his wife have agreed to meet someone at midnight, now each has to get the other to go to sleep, but the film never shows us scenes dealing with that. In the process they pass a good opportunity for some laughs.The music in the film was by Harry Warren, one of the great composers of the times. Sadly the songs are not up to par with some of the other songs he wrote during the period such as ""I Only Have Eyes For You"", ""Lullaby of Broadway"", and ""42nd Street"". The best song in this film is ""Why Do I Dream Those Dreams"" the worst ""Goin' To Heaven On A Mule"", a perfect example of how the songs do not match the story-line, but insteadwas used as a showcase for Jolson.""Wonder Bar"" had the makings of a great film, it's sad to see how things went so badly.Bottom-line: An unclever hybrid of drama and music. The story deserved to be taken serious instead comes second to the songs. Missed comedic opportunities don't help either. One big mess of a film.",Wonder Bar VHS

1229004,"Yes the acting in ""The Reader"" film is superb, the visual scenes perfected to a fault, the ability to expose the raw emotions of guilt and the need in trying to redeem oneself, are all here in this film, but for what purpose?Is this film really trying to show a realistic side to Germany's past or just another movie trying to pull at our emotional strings in an attempt of grasping an Oscar?I may seem cynical, but for me this film too readily glosses over the cruelty that some people perpetrated at this time. The repetitive scenes of perfect gray backgrounds endless shots of pouting by all the characters with somber music to assist in the mood and the classic film filler of smoking a cigarette for dramatic effect of deep contemplation (Freud would say of guilty sexual pleasures) is too scripted for my pallet.I can understand that many people will find this film a profound revelation and/or even a classic representation of flawless acting that achieves a balance of realism seldom found in the Hollywood movie industry.For me however, it loses purpose, by not exposing the ugly side of human nature for which we are all vulnerable to regardless of nationality, faith, or moral upbringing.The film is too self absorbed into the characters of Hanna and Michael's feeling of guilt and shame which makes them come across somewhat pathetic and bland. It overindulges in trying to have us feel sympathetic to the characters plights.Like most people if you like soap operas you will probably love this movie. If not, you may find this film a bit staged and historically compromised to appease the Oscar Gods.",N/A

924863,"Lately, there have been a lot of PG-13 rated horror movies, most of which have drawn critical and public lambasting.  BOOGEYMAN, CURSED, THE GRUDGE, WHITE NOISE, even RING 2.  One criticism often leveled by the public is that the ""whimpy"" PG-13 rating is causing the filmmakers to soften the horror of the movies.  Well, this weekend saw the arrival of an R-rated horror movie, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, and it pretty much proves one thing...the R-rating ISN'T what these other movies were lacking to be good.AMITYVILLE is a lousy movie, pure and simple.  I'm old enough to remember the original phenomenon.  The Lutz family buys a house for a great price because the previous residents had been horrifically murdered in it.  28 days later, the Lutz's run from the house in horror because they nearly suffered the same fate.  Soon, a ""non-fiction"" novel of their story came out.  The Lutz's made the rounds of less picky talk shows and basically, a huge urban legend sprung up.  Their story was TRUE!!  (Of course, it was all a hoax, but who cares about that!).  Then a movie came out, and everyone was all in an uproar over the walls that bled!  Cool!!!  But the movie, with James Brolin and Margot Kidder was schlock then and it's certainly dreadful now.Then here comes a remake that doesn't even bring the zeitgeist of the original with it.  We take it as pure fiction right from the get-go, despite the title card stating ""Based on a True Story.""  Yep, it truly is a story alright.The thrills are predictable in the extreme.  Most of them are heralded with a burst of loud music.  Over and over.  Now, I will grant you that horror movies have been doing this for years...but this movie makes the most of the device.  It accompanies EVERYTHING that might be even remotely creepy.  LOUD NOISE=HUGE THRILL!!! Right??Wrong.  In one scene, the father (played by a bushy faced Ryan Reynolds...designed to make him look like the bearded James Brolin from the original) is watching some home movies.  He smiles.  Suddenly, one of the kids' faces briefly turns demonic, right on the film.  LOUD, LOUD BLAST OF SOUND!!  I just about had to laugh.  This wasn't scary at all.  The kid wasn't going to come out of the film and attack the father. It was just a weird little thing that would have been more effective with quiet music or none at all.  But no, why be subtle when a SLEDGEHAMMER OF SOUND is readily available.  Thus, the movie renders all its thrills equal.  There's really no sense of climax.  Right near the end, something horrible happens to a major character, and we actually think, ""Cool, the movie is daring enough to surprise us in this way.""  Nope, it was just a dream.Also horrific is the fact that the wonderfully talented Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights) plays the local priest as though a gun were being held to his head.  I assume he got a nice paycheck, or maybe did it on a bet or a dare, but he sure looks unhappy to be in this film.I give the film 2 stars, because I reserve 1 star reviews for the true dregs of the earth like FEAR DOT COM or THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES.  But this movie is just clumsy, unexciting and UNTHRILLING.  As for the R rating?  Well, one ""F"" bomb is dropped, and there are some disturbing images when we discover what REALLY happened on the land the house was built on.  Mind you, I said disturbing.  But not scary.  So, I don't recommend the movie for kids...or anyone else, for that matter!",The Amityville Horror
1632014,"In the Eighties, legend has it, the US armed forces hit upon the idea of encouraging Hollywood to make recruitment films for them. Thus, An Officer and a Gentleman, Top Gun, Navy SEALS and Private Benjamin (okay: maybe not Private Benjamin) were bankrolled by Uncle Sam specifically to make the military look glamorous so impressionable minds might sign up. As far as my mates were concerned it had the desired effect. Since we were slap bang in the middle of Nowheresville, South Pacific, they enlisted not for the Top Gun program but as RNZAF cadets and wound up clanking around the Chatham Islands in a forty-year-old Hercules. As far as I know they&#8217;re still doing it now. As a consequence, to this day none of them can abide Val Kilmer. But no matter.Latterly this military recruitment tactic seemed to have fallen out of favour, but it might be back: Ben Affleck&#8217;s new movie Runner Runner plays so moralistically as a lecture against the evils of online gaming you have to wonder whether FBI&#8217;s Cybercrime Fraud folk didn&#8217;t have a stake &#8211; excuse the pun.Subtext: online gaming can corrupt innocent and brilliant minds all too easily.In Runner Runner, the possessor of said innocent and brilliant mind is a chap whom we note, with some irony, made his name corrupting them: Justin Timberlake. His character is Ted, or Fred, or Jack &#8211; not 20 minutes after the credits rolled I honestly can&#8217;t remember &#8211; a wily Princeton brainbox, already in penury for inciting games of chance amongst his college buddies, and about to get in a bit deeper when he starts mixing it with Mr Big on a Carribean Island.Oddly, Timberlake has transmogrified himself from jailbait sex magnet into a faintly oatmealish actor (if Affleck is Theodore Logan, Timberlake is William S. Preston all over) whose only remaining mystery is how he ever passed for a sex symbol, even to a twelve year old, in the first place.Affleck here plays the more charismatic part of dastardly e-Casino magnate Ivan Block. Still, this is a dramatic return to form for an unremarkable actor who has, of late, been doing a fine impression of having more to him than ever used to meet the eye.Unltimately, Runner Runner is simply a paint-by-numbers Overcoming the Monster yarn with a strange title. It relies for its glamour on the absurd contrivance that people who set up online gaming companies in places like Costa Rica actually go out there and live in Bachanalian Xanadus, humping scores of prostitutes and throwing hapless local thugs to crocodiles. Here&#8217;s the news, folks: the only people who make money in tax havens by actually living there do so by preparing board resolutions. No crocodiles.In this alternative universe (the same one inhabited by Tom Cruise&#8217;s The Firm, incidentally) there is therefore an exotic locale for Oatey Justin to voyage to, and armed henchmen, dopey customs officials, sharp-dressed undercover Feds and foxes by the armful to kick the meagre plot along. Gemma Arterton plays a budget Bond girl who seems to have been sprayed with Ronseal fencing stain.Duly kicked, Runner Runner certainly canters along. It is not blighted by continuity errors, dialogue howlers or the dull and awkward moments that beset the comparable but inferior Savages. It isn&#8217;t a bad night out, but it&#8217;s short a car chase or two to be a decent actioner (charging round a carpark with a handycam is no substitute), and is missing a sandwich or two from the picnic hamper if it&#8217;s trying to make a political point.Routine.Olly Buxton","Runner, Runner"

Specific scenes are actually exactly the same as various paintings by Roger Dean which is a disgrace, in my book. Oh the film rocks alright, but primarily because of the sequences that take place on the alien world the human characters are attempting to free of its natural resources. These sequences are brilliantly colorful, and completely appropriated from Roger Dean's ""Dragon Dreams"", and lets not forget the blue aliens in the Star War's saga by George Lucas. In that sense the film is the most transparent attempt to rip off other creative people I have ever seen.

The special effects and the way people die are just so stupid and farfetched! But the film did have a few things going for it such as a returning character (Jennifer Ritchkoff), some gorier scenes that have part one shedding a tear, and a better killer clown mask... but most of it was worn down by its bad dialogue!Plot: After the grisly events from part one of the Camp Blood Trilogy a film director approaches the survivor of the whole ordeal and wants her to be executive producer and to let the actors know how she felt when the killings started and ended (Which she does a terrible job doing because she doesn't ever do anything except recall flashbacks)! She sees it as a way to leave the asylum that she was admitted to and accepts the offer. Now with his so called $130 million budget he meets the cast with his two man crew (one who is an alcoholic and the other is a pot head) and they begin to make the movie. But the killings never ended instead they grew! Now the team soon realizes that they are being chased and slaughtered by a killer that isn't clowning around! Can Tricia (Jennifer Ritchkoff) save what is left of the team or even try to stop this new killer that wants only revenge!Review: Phew that plot stinks and it reeks of bad story build up and just dreaded story in general! Now that I have got that out of my system I must say that this did feel more like a slasher flick than the fist mainly due to the bloodier and a more frequent towards the end kind of body count! The first two victims don't even make sense though, because they are never explored or even mentioned in the rest of the movie and even one of the deaths they person dies from having his hand chopped off... I know that if no medical attention was acquired for this poor soul then he would eventually die but this person dies in like 10-15 seconds and the individual barley even screams!!! I do like though how they did more with this movie and how the killer ""gets rid of the competition"" to be apart of this massacre or should I say cause this massacre. They really knew what they wanted to do with this sequel especially considering it was made in a little less than half a year! This movie is especially a good watch because it has a helluvalot of entertainment and cheap thrills that give us a lot of bloody bodies to help boost the interest of the viewer even if the deaths are incredibly unrealistic!Acting: This is ridiculous... the first one tried acting all serious but failed and this time it tries to be stupid-funny and fails yet again! The worst set up I believe that the one of the characters endured was when the ""Director"" (whom was played by Garret Clancy) was all attracted and in love with the girl (mostly because of her breasts) that got the part to play Jennifer Ritchkoff role and then the next day when she didn't show he acted like he never even heard of the actresses name! It had ridiculous acting and overall dreaded dialogue.... especially when the people portraying the original victims for the movie acted that's when I thought I couldn't take anymore!Gore: an off-screen slit throat is what starts up the movie and then the machete through the stomach to kick off the last death until the 40-50 minute mark! After that we get the dreaded hand chopped off with a machete scene, a guy is sliced and diced like crazy with a machete, a woman gets a machete impaled through her face and out her head (because... where else would it go... I'm kidding and using very bad sarcasm to go along with it, were was I, oh yeah) that death actually looked good and I was quite surprised, we also get a machete sliced into ones head (with smoke, yes I said it smoke coming out of his head... along with a lot of blood, he must've been very aggravated because that was the scene when everyone left the set and the director was getting very angry and then *Spoiler Alert* gets his steaming demise *End Spoiler*), a cool looking throat slashing, a piece of shard glass from a bottle is shoved into a mans eyes, a burnt face, a machete sliced into a victims neck and more... there is a very hilarious scene where the alcoholic (Shemp, I wonder where they got that name from *Hint* Evil Dead *End Hint*) punches a girl because he was confused and drunk and she was screaming and I guess it just pissed him off to much!Bottom Line: Director Brad Sykes is very talented in doing what he does and with what he has. There was another dislike I had about this movie and it was that pretty much all the character names from part one were used in part two for totally different characters.... one other thing I liked how ever was the whole revenge theme that unfolds at the end.. .it was very well played out and that's what made it feel more like a true and serious slasher flick!Suggested MPAA: Rated: R for strong violence and gore, some sexuality/nudity, and languageIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 1For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 2",Camp Blood 2

1241285,"This was my first experience with the 48 hour rental from Amazon. And probably my last, unless I hear that they overhaul the player. $3.99 is a little steep in the age of Netflix, but when you're in the mood for Harry Potter... When I stream things at home from Hulu, Netflix or other sites the quality is great. As the film opened the quality was terrible, pixelated to the point that we could barely see what was happening. We stopped it, exited out and restarted, which helped a great deal. With about a half hour left, the movie froze up. We waited for 5 minutes or so and ended up having to re-start it again and find our place, wait for it to load. And then it would not allow us to use full screen! It just wouldn't!

Giovanni Ribisi has a ton of talent but it is wasted on this convoluted script which  has no direction and takes the viewer nowhere.

The relationship between Ribisi and his father is  ridiculous.  So basically the only thing that makes this movie good is  watching these sharks in action.  The movie contains some great one-liners  and the action on the floor is key.  But overall, the narration is taken  right from Goodfellas 101 as is the camera work on some of the more violent  scenes.  I mean seriously any movie whose key quote was penned by the  Notorious BIG is trying really hard not to be taken seriously.",N/A
532559,"........you're about 10 years old!ok - first - the ad campaigns are terribly misleading.  this isn't a ""change your life""/""i had a near-death-experience and massive awakening"" movie; if you go into it expecting this you will be sorely disappointed.  instead, this is a more serious type of *batman* or *superman* flick with a morose, monotone, somber, melodramatic superhero sans the exaggerations of ""supernatural"" powers and strength.in other words this is a comic book on film - and little more.  really, that's the straight scoop on this flick; i kid you not!the acting is good all around, considering that the mood of this film is droll and dreary throughout - i think there was ONE joke in the entire film; aside from that all of the characters bore the same overly serious expression.  (did any of the characters actually crack a smile at all??)there could have been so much more to this movie had it been taken in the *fearless*/*awakenings*/*the game*/*cast away* direction.  but alas it was not.and the ending - it is absolutely preposterous and mathematically ludicrous.  it makes no sense - either in its conception or in the fact that it ACTUALLY worked out from the character's perspective!!  but .......... if you keep in mind that this is basically a comic book on film, then the ending may be a bit easier to swallow.on a positive note, i am forever grateful to M. Night Shyamalan for only taking 1:40 minutes to tell this story.  if this had been stretched out to 3 hours like *the green mile* or *magnolia* i would have to write a seriously disparaging review and subtract stars, etc., etc.  but as it is it's a two-star movie with a lame ending that only wastes 1:40 minutes of your life and offers a few interesting ideas as compensation (unlike *the green mile* or *magnolia* which had no redeeming qualities at all - can you tell how much i hated these movies? ...",Unbreakable

It's not at all what it seems at first, a conspiracy theory movie -- not that that would have been an improvement, it's just that this particular paranormal theme is done, and it has the same ending twist *******************SPOILER AHEAD **************************** as the Sixth Sense, without the better acting that makes that movie watchable.

1196933,"Sure, The Matrix is not very realistic, but it's sci-fi. I thought this was going to be a more believable, regular action movie. But regular action movies don't feature assassins using centrifical force to make bullets curve out of guns, or make the bullets turn corners and go around things like a miniature guided missle. Not to mention being able to aim exactly where to land their cars after flipping them through the air. And what kind of assassin training prepares them to survive inside a high-speed train car that plummets thousands of feet down a canyon? Just a little overkill on the incredible here. If this were a movie version of Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, then it would be OK! Oh yeah, you get shot? No problem, just submerge yourself into some high-tech mix of water and concrete, and presto! You're healed within minutes!This just didn't feel like a real sci-fi type movie, so to me it's just a highly unrealistic action movie.And were the screenwriters trying to set some kind of record as to how many times they could squeeze the f-word into their script? Even the nerdy fat-lady boss spews the f-word seemingly more times per minute than Eddie Murphy in Raw! A lame, cop-out attempt to spice up the script that just doesn't work. A real turn-off...I don't mind much hearing it if it's just here and there, but regular, dignified-looking people in an office setting rattling it off every three seconds is a bit overkill.I guess this is based on some comic series, but the characters in this movie just don't have much pizzaz or personality--they're just regular hoods, and McAvoy's character is just some geek who turns into some Rambo type within six weeks. The plainness of these characters don't lend themselves to a story with such crazily unrealistic action. It's not a boring movie, it goes fast with plenty of action, but not much charm to it, sorry.THUMBS DOWN!",N/A
66430,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.The first and only movie directed by Sir Alfred Hitchcock to depict graphic violence & nudity has an interesting plot (man wrongly suspected of murder, while the real criminal is the last person you'd expect), but fails to capitalise on the initial suspense we've come to expect from films like Shadow Of A Doubt, Rope, North By Northwest, Vertigo & Psycho. The depiction of graphic violence & nudity was unneccessary (implying it increases the suspense and ultimately detracts from the story; unless you're doing a documentary on the Holocaust or on African tribes or a movie about the Holocaust, then I think nudity is absolutely unneccessary, as is graphic violence). There is one good scene where the murderer goes into a room with his victim, then the door closes as the camera pans back all the way down the stairs and out into the street. And a hilarious scene where the inspector feigns to eat his wife's nasty dinner while telling her about the case. However, those are the only good scenes in the film.I DO NOT recommend this movie. Stick to Saboteur, Shadow Of A Doubt, Rope, Strangers On A Train, Rear Window, To Catch A Thief, Dial M For Murder, North By Northwest, Vertigo & Psycho for pure, unadulterated suspense.This film is rated R (a rape scene with nudity, mild-to-strong language and three scenes of non-sexual nudity).",N/A
245597,"Having had the VHS version of The Dead for many years, I was happy to see the DVD version finally being released after all these years- so I pre-ordered it.  I just sat down to watch it again and was very disappointed to see that the film had been cut, with several scenes deleted.  In particular, they must have decided they wanted to practically cut Donal Donnelly's Freddie Malins character out of the movie, as they cut two scenes early in the movie that provided great (drunken) comic relief- his entrance and bathroom scene (""anything under a mile and he'd miss the finish"") the racing discussion and story Freddie tells of 'old man gallaher' and the girl practicing with a piglet story.As the film is a slice of life story centered on a dinner party in 1904 Dublin, it is a pity these scenes and other bits were cut.  I don't see any reason for the cuts- it's not like this was a long film to begin with, or that they needed to cut it to fit it on a single DVD.A great film has been cheapened by Lionsgate.  They, or someone else more capable, should provide a full-length version of this movie to do justice to John Huston as his last film.  They should also offer a free exchange for those unfortunate enough to buy this version thinking it was a full-length version of the film.",N/A

However, if you are a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis you might find something worthy of your interest.The story centers around a group of eccentric friends, armed with weapons they can hardly use, going to the backwoods for an hunting expedition. Our main character has some loosely described history about an uncle and hillbilly friends,not to mention a giant pig, but this is not explored at all. In fact, his former backwoods buddies rather unexepectedly just show up with no explanation. As do a ""hippie"" cult that has some unexplained connection to the large pig that makes a cameo near the end of the flick (or at least his head does). There are numerous storylines that are simply left dangling, and watching the movie can be an exercise in frustration. There is simply no reason for any of this to be happening. Then again, if you like a series of random events this might be right up your alley. I just cannot recommend it.",N/A
619246,"I don't know what all the hype was about, I don't know why this movie recieved any awards of any sort? I guess it was also supposed to be a bit of a comedy too? I think this will just be one of the movies I either don't get, or I saw the point but it was so small, I expected something bigger. I first saw a big chunck of this movie with a friend and even he was not amused at the movie. I tried to watch it two other times later to give it a try and I could not get through the whole thing. For me at least, I find this movie to be quiet, somewhat symbolic of something, and just stylish. It is stylish in a way that's not flashy, but trendy and artsy. I think it's hard to explain. I thought there was decent acting, but I don't feel that the actors were given much to do really. You do end up seeing a lot of nice scenes and images in Japan which I can appreciate. It is set in modern day Japan and you have Bill Murray and Scarlett J staring as the main actors...they end up forming a friendship (which I thought was going to turn into something more). You also see Anna Faris (Cindy fron Scary Movie) in kind of the same bubbly spirit.I gave this movie 2 stars but I'd like to really give it 2 1/2 because of the picture and color of it and its style. Other than that, I did not like it. If you tend to like movies like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Equilibrium and things like that, you will most likely not like this film. If you like Tom Hanks kind of films, this is probably right up your alley.",Lost in Translation
851438,"This was a good attempt.  It was probably more historically accurate than any of the plethora of other Arthurian works on film.  I have no complaint concerning the quality thespianism demonstrated here.

Magick is in all mythology; even christian.  It's called something else, of course, but it's all Magick, just the same.While I enjoyed this attempt, it just was not the Legend of King Arthur I embrace.  The Magick and mysticism are gone from it, and it lost all attraction for me.  It felt like watching Spiderman with no powers, or Superman when he couldn't fly.

1447548,"As a huge fan of Damages I have clung to every episode like an addict awaiting my fix. This show hit the ground running- it was intense and addicting from the very first shot in which the elevator doors open and out stumbles our protagonist Ellen, the poor weak little waif who wanders out the door and into our tv world plus into the world of antagonist sociopath Patty who, by the way, makes Alex Forrest from &#34;Fatal Attraction&#34; look like Mother Theresa.I think I totally marathon-watched every single ep for not just the first season but also the second and third within probably a week. I was that hooked. Then for some reason the FX channel dropped it (probably b/c it didn't have enough profanity and borderline porn that their other shows offer) and I had to retrieve seasons four and five from the internet. As with Mad Men's 5th season which also came after an unexpected delay I found the series had declined. The characters are still riveting but the writing just didn't generate much interest with its plots and storylines which used to be full of twists. The genius of the first three seasons just seems to have bailed out of the fourth and fifth seasons.(Since season five is not here to review I'm gonna comment on both of the last two seasons.) The plot in season four is just not as interesting. The same can be said of season five. Only season five is worse. Everything bad about season four is doubled in season five really. Both seasons show too much flashing back- in season four, it is within the season- they keep showing the same scenes repeated over and over. In season five, they keep showing either dreams recurring over and over or they show flashbacks from the first, second and third seasons. Season five also consists of a lot of shots of Ryan Phillipe's naked butt as he bangs various chicks. Then there are various scenes that drag on and on while the viewer waits for something ANYTHING to happen. For example, Patty and Ellen are stranded in a Maine airport during a snowstorm. I thought something good was gonna happen but the only &#34;excitement&#34; that occurred was when Patty broke in to the liquor cabinet. WHOA!!! The whole episode practically was devoted to the two women sitting in an airport munching on crackers from the vending machine. It's actually even less exciting than I'm making it out to be. They could have added some shots of the paint chipping off the walls and that might've helped!Both seasons were very slow and too convoluted. What really made the show exciting during the first three seasons was not only the great characters but also the fast-paced movement of the show- it didn't wait for you. During the first three years, from the minute each season started it was like an adrenaline rush to see each new episode and find out what was gonna happen. It was exciting. I got so many people hooked on Damages in the beginning. EVERYONE loved it. Sadly, though, all good things must come to an end. I'm sure it's dfficult to maintain that kind of stamina year after year. So if you are a fan of the show (at least for the first three seasons) but debated about whether or not to purchase seasons four and five, beware that the two final seasons may not live up to the standard set by the previous three. They are still better than like 95% of the crap on tv now but just don't get your hopes up.Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are still amazing in their roles and the guest stars add a lot as well- John Goodman in season four and Ryan Phillipe in season five. But performances are not enough to save a failing show. As I said, all these good shows eventually start to decline- I loved the first few seasons of Mad Men as well as Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy but all have just lost their luster in my opinion. I wish I had better news- I believe as with Mad Men that I am in the minority when I say the show isn't as good but that's fine. I'm glad some people still like the shows. However, I see from other reviews that it's not just me. Whatever... people are entitled to their opinions and I'm sure people who vehemently support a show no matter how bad it gets will certainly express that. But I'm just trying to be helpful to those people who, as I said above, may be debating about watching/purchasing seasons four and five. To them I say: get them off the internet or from Net- -flix but save your money if you were thinking of buying them.",Damages: Season 4
1123321,"I was going to give this three stars, but I am sometimes too nice! The only bright spot in this one was the absolutely adorable Abbie Cornish as ""Bess"". And I thought I could only love Charlize Theron, one of the most beautiful women to ever appear on a movie screen!!! Of course I do have somewhat of a crush on Scarlett Johannson, but don't tell Charlize that. But I digress. Throughout ""Lizzie Two"" most of the cast seemed to be sleepwalking. Clive Owen's portrayal was particularly boring. Errol Flynn would've certainly been much better in the role, but alas and alack, he is no longer with us! The battle scene with the Spanish Armada was really dull and pretty much anti-climactic. And oh, those seemingly endless ""big lighting"" effects with Elizabeth. Maybe this should have been titled ""Elizabeth, The Savior Queen"". I think Kapur should've reviewed some of the period pieces from the 30's and 40's. They usually had the required dash and panache that this one lacks. And what was with all those real high shots? Were they supposed to impress us little people? Some directors just fall in love with themselves after a dash of success. George Lucas' Star War series comes to mind. I gave this two stars only because it is still a cut above Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"", the epitomy of a bad ""historical"" movie. Was Mel already on the ""sauce"" when he made that one? (By the way, I really like Mel's ""We Were Soldiers"", just so you don't think I'm anti-Mel.) Some of these folks in the movie business must have a very low opinion of our intelligence. (Do ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" come to mind?) My other pet peeve about this movie and some others concerns the dialogue. Whatever happened to recording the characters dialogue in a clear, distinct manner. Actors should never be speaking whilst turned away from the camera. And I do have a good sound system in my home. About $4,000.00 worth. I get tired of going back over the same line two or three times trying to understand what is being said!!!

1120694,"Will this new wave of ""war on terror"" movies ever end? Almost none of them work because: they don't change people's opinions, they pretend to be morally superior (self-importance), they give us the wrong impressions and their messages are way too bias--this is Hollywood after all and we all know which side of the political spectrum they're on--to even take any of them seriously. In the end, these movies turn out to be more offensive (even for the Arabs) than anything else. I'm certain that whatever is happening behind the government's curtain is far more dramatic and interesting than boring films like Rendition--heck! At least The Kingdom had action in it. Not only the film is uninspiring, boring and extremely long, the A-class American actors are so lifeless that seem to be ""pasted"" into the film. I surrendered to Rendition after an hour and change. The real suffering is watching it.Brief Intro Story:An explosion in North Africa generates an investigation to find out the perpetrators--one American is killed. A little bit after that incident, family man Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) is kidnapped at the airport by a secret ""law enforcement"" agency--He was supposed catch a plane from South Africa to Chicago. Apparently he is now a suspect of terrorism and taken to a secret location for interrogation--He is a legal US resident and apparently innocent. Meanwhile rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to observe the brutal interrogation of Anwar by the local law enforcement--he was near that explosion, he wants to do his job, but doesn't like what he sees.After waiting for few days, Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) begins to investigate the disappearance of her husband--she is pregnant, but this doesn't stop her from finding out the truth. As the film continues, Douglas begins to have second thoughts about his job and the real truth behind that explosion appears for all to see.Review:Director Gavin Hood makes a bad mistake by creating two parallel stories with no success in any of them. In one hand we have a ""Romeo and Juliet"" soapy Arab love story, and in the other, we get the laid-back and boring CIA agent Douglas who doesn't do much but getting laid, watches poor Anwar being tortured for few days, but all of the sudden, he wants to do the right thing by going against US policy on terror and trying to understand and even help the prisoner--which is not his call. How exciting is that? Even though, these stories are related, the movie jumps from scene to scene lacking the notion of time with fuzzy continuity. This non-chronological approach (done better in other films) unfortunately is not the only editing issue; the film is extremely long (120 minutes). Too long for a film that has virtually no action sequences, but little character development and few forced dramatic moments--for example the torture scenes for the most part, but they are not that shocking.Many of you are wondering why I didn't mention in my introduction that this film has Academy Award-winning Meryl Streep and Academy Award-winning Alan Arkin. What is wrong with this picture? The problem is the way our actors portray their clich&eacute; characters--yes, those evil, heartless government officials in charge of the war on terror (I'm being sarcastic here). In other words, our American actors have very little material--and screen time--to work with. They are nothing but stereotypes that show no emotions even in dire straits situations and at times, seem to be bored to even be in the film. It's an easy paycheck after all. But why is it about Oscar winners that after getting one statue, they get bad roles?The Verdict:Rendition has an agenda and clearly displays it by showing its own view of what's happening to detainees in this messy War on Terror. Of course, you would expect this kind of bias from Hollywood. The real issue here is that the movie is way too slow; it has cero character development with boring performances and clich&eacute; stereotypes--except for few scenes from the prisoner that are quite dramatic--that doesn't inspire nor entertain us. Please do yourself a favor and watch other far better dramas about this issue like Syriana.",N/A
1484669,"I'm an enormous fan of Burton's earlier stuff, and Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my all-time favorite movies. But, other than Sweeney Todd, his later work has been leaving me kind of cold. I love monster movies, and I caught every reference in this film, and I wanted to like it. I really did want to. I just didn't. It was kind of boring.I had the same problem with this that I had with Corpse Bride, which is that his characters are designed so that they never really look all that interested in what's going on around them. They don't seem affected, which makes it hard for me to care about what's going on either. I get that this isn't using real actors, but this isn't something that affected Nightmare Before Christmas, where the characters showed actual emotion. But here it seems like we get a couple tears pooling and that's it. The rest of it is strangely monotone.Also, the monsters in the second half were kind of scary for a kid's movie. Assuming this was a kid's movie. It was marketed that way, and it isn't terribly complex, which makes me think it can't possibly be for adults. But it's seems too scary for kids under seven or eight. I think the cat metamorphosing into a half-bat winged creature with claws that then scuttled around the room lightening fast only to try to attack people is a little much for kids under that age. And it's going to be too slow for most kids over eleven or twelve. If it is meant for kids, that leaves Burton a very narrow audience. If he meant to aim for adults, well, he underestimated his viewers' level of sophistication.The movie simply seemed bland, even curiously boring. Burton probably got a lot of people through the door based on the trailer, which was far more interesting than the actual movie, but the audience likely to really enjoy this movie seems small.

522394,"I am a huge action fan, love most of Tom Cruise's movies, and loved the first Mission:Impossible movie.  However, this one is not on par with that movie by any stretch of the imagination.  I actually thought of giving this movie 1 star, but some of the action and visual effects were stunning, so that boosted my score.The film starts out brilliantly, and the mountain scene was breathtaking.  It all goes downhill from there...  I really think John Woo is off his rocker.  In the commentary in one of the special features on the DVD, he says he wanted to direct a love story.  Good try buddy!  And the action scenes were overdone and unrealistic.  I am impressed that Cruise did most of his stunts, but some of the stuff was just stupid, like the cartwheel kick at the end.  Can you actually tell me that someone would not be able to get out of the way?  They should have just stuck with a realistic fight scene, where the blows would actually hurt in real life.  This was further worsened by the slo-mo that was used constantly.  At least at regular speed it may have looked somewhat believable.Despite the problems I had with some of the action scenes, the worst part of the movie had to do with all the masks that were used.  I mean, how believable is it that Cruise kept a mask of his face, as well as a mask of each of the bad guys?  Added to that, who would believe that it was the same guy?  Remember, Cruise is short...at least three inches shorter than Dougray Scott.

LOOK AT MY WORK OF ART!""Apparently, Punch-Drunk Love is some sort of American rip of Jean Pierre Jeunet's Amelie, with a similar plot line involving 2 dysfunctional individuals seeking love -- both films with a ""dark"" subplot which threatens the central character's pursuit & realization of that union (Amelie w/the picture booth, PDL w/ the phone sex gang)...Some sort of masturbatory filmmaking by the ""in crowd"" of Hollywood, PDL seems more concerned with tooting its own horn & parading is ""artistry"" than building strong or remotely interesting narrative & characters... And I don't think that breaking genre coventions has to be a painful viewing experience.Where Amelie provided history & background to support the pathos of the leads & empathy, PDL provides none. The film is so cruel to Emily Watson's character, that it doesn't even give a clue as to her inexplicable attraction to Sandler's character, except maybe some sort of twisted autistic fetish (?!)The air is a bit too thick with pretense for my taste, and I just can't bring myself to contribute another laurel to Anderson's pile of collective hubris.",Punch-Drunk Love

It didn't sell consequence but tries to sell heroic significance which I can learn to respect. However, I must say, 9/11 was not a good day and it changed my world as much as it changed yours. United 93, even with a grizzling build up - failed to remotely emotivate me. It was emotionally impotent and quite a few strands (namely - the character build up, the understanding transferred to the audience) were strayed about.The reason I had big expectations from this film is because the particular incident changed a lot of things about our planet. It changed the way we Asians are welcomed in the west (Security checks, dubious random checkings by authorities,etc) , 9/11 brought the world closer and made the minorities more recognizable, a sense of cold dread adulterated with friendly humanity from all sides - - all in all, fills the world today.

415122,"""Camelot"" on Broadway was cursed with the most excrutiatingly boring book that droned on and on and on.  But the production was blessed with a stellar cast including Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet and an excellent score which included ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" powerfully sung by Mr. Goulet.Joshua Logan was tapped to direct the film version and of all the reasons why the film failed-Logan as the director was the biggest.  Richard Harris as King Arthur when he wasn't hamming it up acted so morose you would think someone told him all the pubs in England had run dry.Vanessa Redgrave made an enchanting Guinevere but her demeanor was somewhat on the frosty side.Although the film boasted scenes of castles, vast meadows and grand castle ceremonial halls, Joshua Logan filmed a lot of the movie using extreme close-ups of his actors.  And a tight close-up on Richard Harris' face on the giant cinemascope screen was especially distracting. When he sang his nose-hair could be seen swaying to the music. And on one of Vanessa Redgraves close-ups, it was obvious she had a cold, and a joker in the movie audience shouted, ""Arthur get thy wife a hankie,""--Ok! Ok!

93431,"I really liked this film when I first saw it in theatres, even as I doubted a lot of methods in which Stone draws his conclusions and retells his ""facts.""  The cast is good and, to be such a long film, it holds together.But in the years since then, a lot more has come out about the Kennedy assassination--and Stone's film.I just watched a show on the History Channel last night that completely destroys this movie's entire conspiracy theory.  It WAS possible for Oswald to get off three shots from 88 yards (and an 89-year-old man did it nearly a dozen times to demonstrate it); the fatal head shot DID come from behind the president (as shown in the autopsy); the ""magic bullet"" DID create the wounds in Kennedy and Governor Connally without turning or ""hanging in the air"" (a computer recreation showed how everyone was sitting for that to happen).Can these things still be argued?  I believe that anyone looking at all the data available now would have a hard time doing so.  But I know they will.  There's a paranoid guy at work who's passing out cheaply-made ""documentaries"" of what REALLY happened on 9-11, so crazy theories about everything will always be around.It was also disappointing to find out that Jim Garrison, the crusading attorney played Kevin Costner, was revised by Stone for his movie--and that Stone completely embellished his final speech in the film.  Garrison never said that!I don't really have much of a problem with that kind of artistic license, but only if it's acknowledged.  As long as Oliver Stone continues to insist that his version of JFK is reality, then it tends to make open-minded viewers a little squeamish.""Well, if that's not how it happened, then it should have!""That sounds more like something Michael Moore would say....",JFK Director's Cut

The preposterous ""Turbulent Skies"" is a kissing cousin to the camp classic ""Airport 1975"" without the star wattage, overwrought performances, or manic intensity. Combining the estimable talents of Casper van Dien, Nicole Eggert, and Patrick Muldoon--it's not like I expected this film to compete for Oscars. I'd just hoped for a bit more fun. Everyone plays it far too straight (where's a cross-eyed Karen Black when you need her?) and the resultant film is patently dull as opposed to genuine B-movie magic. The screenplay is riddled with holes and lapses of logic, the film just needed to embrace its inherent silliness and go with it. But by asking us to take it seriously and to care, the director has missed his chance to elevate this to campy greatness. As is, only the most stalwart fans of one of the leads might be interested in this rather tedious exercise. There are plenty of more effective low budget adventures in the DVD marketplace--try to catch this on cable sometime before plopping down hard earned dollars to own it!The film centers around a new piece of technology that will revolutionize air travel. An auto-pilot device that will make humans obsolete has been developed by Eggert and team. On the test voyage, corporate greed takes over and Muldoon (the requisite bad guy) outfits a commercial airline with the device and invites investors to fly with the untested (and tampered with) unit controlling the plane. I loved how all this happened rather spontaneously--as if there wouldn't be a billion federal regulations to navigate. Soon a 747 is loaded with potential victims (By loaded, I mean 12 people. Seriously--3 corporate representatives, 4 crew members, 2 reporters, and 3 investors). All this is for THREE investors--even though no one seems to know how many people to expect. Muldoon has prepared extravagant gift bags, there are trays of champagne, and the flight attendant even attempts to shut the door before the reporters get on. No flight manifest? Can't count to twelve?Of course, the unit malfunctions and takes the plane off course. Even though there are no signs of the plane actually crashing, the military decide to shoot it down before it gets to a city. Preventive medicine, I suppose. Van Dien plays Eggert's estranged husband who might be able to save the day (and their marriage) if only he can get onto the flight. Well, he does--just in time to clip some wires. Thank goodness he was there. Eggert still has to single handedly save the day (good thing she had that rescue training on Baywatch). Again, it's all just silly--had it aspired to dumb fun, it might have worked. But I really think they wanted you to care about the thinly drawn characters and personal drama and touching moments of heroism. A low budget thriller, in which the low budget really shows and the thrills are limited, ""Turbulent Skies"" is instantly forgettable--assuming you make it to the end. Now, I really am going to re-watch ""Airport 1975"" in all its campy glory! KGHarris, 6/11.",Turbulent Skies

1191408,"End of the world movies can generally be categorized into one of three categories.  The first is the zombie scenario, which is probably the most popular in terms of ticket sales and advertising.  Examples of this genre including everything from action thrillers like World War Z, to gory horror flicks like the Resident Evil franchise, to comedies like ZombieLand.  The second category are the alien invasion movies.  Here we have films like Skyline, Storage 24, Oblivion, and others of this kind.  Then there is everything else, few of which see much success.  A good example of the latter is ""The Road"" which came out in 2009.  Set in a near future where smoky fires cloud the skies yet rain and gloom cover the earth, the film seems set in a USA after a nuclear war has disabled the infrastructure of modern technology.  The plot follows a man and his son who travel westward to the Pacific Ocean hoping to find any community to live with.  Along the way they meet cannibals, criminals, and other refugees.  The father dreams about his past, life before the catastrophe, and shortly thereafter up to and including the birth of their son.  There is also a long running dialogue between father and son about good and evil, and whether they count as good people versus some of the evil people they have met.

859440,"""Locked Up"" is a pretty appalling movie.  The story is absolutely ludicrous.  Do they put prisoners guilty of credit card fraud in with hardened, violent criminals?  Maybe they do.  It's been a long time since I was in a German prison, but do they really let you pick your own cellmates, bring your own furniture, decorate the walls, have your pets, make your own coffee?  The warden asks at what point, ""What do you think this is?  A hotel?""  The answer is, I guess, ""Yes!""The actors were horrible, with a couple of exceptions.  Mike Sale is the worst offender.  He sounds about as American as Queen Elizabeth.  David Parstein gives a sympathetic performance as the wimpy little doormat Kevin.  Better still is Marcel Schlutt.  Yes, he is apparently a big porn star in Europe and is very nice looking, but in this movie at least, he is actually quite sweet and vulnerable.  It would be interesting to see if he would be able to make it in more mainstream movies.  Probably not, but it would be nice to see him in something better.I think this turkey deserves one star, but I'm giving it two because of Schlutt's performance.  Terrible movie, good star.",Locked Up

723922,"I consider myself quite well connected with the late 1960s, even being quite a Joan Baez fan in kindergarten! In the mid-seventies a relative gave me a big stack of old Evergreen Review magazines, and I started an interest in more counter-culture things from the '60s because of that, since I was just a child when much of it took place. One of the films Evergreen released in 1970 that they gave a lot of coverage to was Quiet Days In Clichy, showing tantalizing pics of the cast in naked moments. And in 2004 I finally got to see what the hubbub was about...Mainly a curiosity of the late '60s and of interest mainly for those interested in the ""art"" cinema of that time, this film is really another of those where philosophy and intellectual conversations are padded with people having sex, showing even the intellectuals have a base interest just like everyone else. But since it centers around someone like Henry Miller, it's high art apparently. Certainly off to an interesting start, the film immediately gets one to think though that there is a promise of more like the hardcore footage shown right after the strange credit sequence. That might have been better actually, because instead we then mainly get characters meandering around Paris and Luxembourg, laughing a lot and wondering why they are never satisfied.Here are some of the perplexing things for me:--Joey complains that Nys could have left him a few francs after he first met her and gave her his money, but Joey actually INSISTED she take all of it to begin with.--The guys keep yakking about how Colette's brains are in her genitals and that she just wants to have sex (a feeling they seem to have about women in general), but by watching this whole film it seems Joey and Carl spend all their time trying to get laid as well.--The women are portrayed as a bit mentally off, except for Colette's mother (upon which Carl then just says how hot she was, which seemed like belittling her after she was kind to them).--Joey is a writer, but we rarely see him even doing that, he just complains how he has no money and has nothing to eat, but can spend a lot of time walking around town and looking for sex.--Suddenly while in Luxembourg, and somehow with money, they wind up pouring bottles of wine all over prostitutes and letting the bread they have to just wind up in the tub and going down the drain with the wine. If we're supposed to appreciate Joey and Carl's ""bohemian lifestyle,"" it doesn't help that they just waste food and drink after always saying they never have it.--Hoping there would be a resolve to the story, instead, after a naked woman can't have sex with them because she was crying over the memory of her late husband, the others just sit there naked and laugh while the camera zooms in on their genitals. Huhhhh??? That's it?I don't regret seeing this film after wondering for so many years what it was all about, and discovering more curiosities from that era. It's just that I think some people will find any reason to say it's poetic mainly because Henry Miller is involved -- if this were not based on him and just a film of its own, I doubt as many folks would be worshiping it. Had a film been made of a character based on Henry Miller washing dishes for an hour and a half, I'm sure these people would somehow come up with many a thesis on the amazing meanings of it.But it all just comes down to silly naked people laughing, in my eyes...",Quiet Days in Clichy

1243483,"If you are a fan of poorly executed, low budget, monster flicks, Razortooth fits the bill nicely.  You are extremely charitable, if you care about any of the characters, who are neither interesting nor particularly likeable.Somewhere in Florida, a scientist's experimental creation is loose in the swamps, the creature is apparently a giant mutated Asian eel.  Eels are fish that breathe through gills, but greenish, bug-eyed Razortooth, is also able to travel swiftly on land, moving like a snake.  When a couple of prison escapees head into the swamp, the police out to recapture them, become the first victims.  From there, blood starts to spatter, and the bodies quickly pile up, as the eel starts to feed on the clueless locals.The Sheriff (Kathleen LaGue) and her animal control officer ex-husband (Doug Swander), lead a group formed to deal with the threat, which includes the scientist and his helpers.  The inept posse hasn't a chance of success, and the fun really starts as the Razortooth eels continue to chomp up victim after victim.  The CGI eel doesn't look much like a real eel, and isn't particularly well-done until the very end, but even so it is still the film's most interesting character.  Since it appears that air guns are used as props, use of firearms is minimal, and a crossbow becomes the weapon designated to kill the creature.  A plan that is naturally doomed to failure.Razortooth is fun and entertaining, on a very basic bloody, creature feature level.  The writing and acting is barely passable, and only the special effects make the film of any interest.",Razortooth

I swore I wouldn't see this dreck, but eventually caved just to see the train wreck Burton made ... only to NOT hate it as much as I thought, but also (thankfully) to find out that the film is NOT a comedy (and should not have been marketed as such by the studio). There are comedic touches and a black comedy overtone to the film, at times, to be sure - but in general, the story of a centuries-old vampire named Barnabas Collins (Depp), who is released from his coffin prison to walk among the living (and his ancestral home) again, is a tongue-in-cheek drama that is generally just not a good film ... but also not the piece of crap I thought it to be.

The story only really gets going when Kyoshiro's long lost brother turns up and turns out to be a complete monster. The last third of the series moves along well enough and the ending could be a tear jerker if you cared about the main characters at all at that point.

607248,"There's a built-in potential for disappointment in Comedian. The posters, DVD box art, etc. prominently feature Jerry Seinfeld, leading one to believe that it's a film with him as the sole focus. While Mr. Seinfeld is a major part of the film, Comedian both falls short of, and surpasses, the viewer's expectations.I thought the film was about Jerry Seinfeld's return to stand-up after a long and successful television career. While the film does indeed cover this, it also has a parallel story chronicling the struggles of Orny Adams, a talented up-and-comer who is shooting for his big break. It's presented with as much emphasis as Seinfeld's material, tranforming the proceedings.One is tempted to see it as a contrast: the pain of the scrabbling newcomer vs. the comfort of the experienced, wealthy veteran. But soon it becomes clear that it's painful for both of them - that a successful career can only do so much (that is to say, not much at all) to protect a comic from the stark vulnerability of getting on a stage and trying to make an audience laugh. It's always hard, and requires a great deal of work and focus to do.The true contrast is between how the performers approach their work. Mr. Adams is a knot of nervous insecurity, obsessively working and re-working his material, chattering non-stop about talk show appearences and development deals, privately scorning the audience after a perfomance falls short. Mr. Seinfeld, on the other hand, has a far better attitude. He treats the audience and his work with respect - he feels it's his job to make people laugh, and if construction workers can get up and go to work every day, than so can he, regardless of his success. If it doesn't happen, then he simply hasn't done his job.There are tense moments for Mr. Seinfeld when he forgets his material onstage, or is unsatisfied with a television appearance, but there are also calm ones. Quietly preparing backstage. Studying performances of Robert Klein and Richard Pryor at the Museum of Television and Radio. One touching moment has him gently singing to his baby before a performance. It's hard to imagine Mr. Adams doing the same. Indeed, his follow-up segment in the DVD supplement shows him looking lost and alone in a Los Angeles apartment, lamenting his television development deal, still restless and dissatisfied.Comedian is successful at describing the processes, attitudes and goals of two very different comics, as well as depicting the strenuous life on the stand-up circuit. Unfortunately, it's hard not to feel a little cheated when we don't get to see the final run of material Seinfeld has developed over the course of the film. In this regard, the film feels a bit choppy, an accumulation of sound bites that struggles to build to a goal. The DVD release has the Letterman appearances for both comics to compensate, but even this feels inadequate. Comedian splits its focus, attempting to straddle the banks of a making-of-a-concert film and a portrait of the comedy world. As such, it's successful enough to be compelling, but not quite the film it could've been.",N/A

1320382,"This budget-priced Looney Tunes Super Stars line had two sure-fire hits with their first go-round. One was a Bugs Bunny themed set called ""Hare Extraordinaire"" while the other had Daffy Duck cartoons in the name of ""Frustrated Fowl"". This review is for the aptly-named Daffy release.The first six cartoons, produced before the year 1953, are fantastic. They're all nicely restored prints shown in their full frame format.That's the way it should be. Too bad that makes up about 37 minutes of a nearly two hour disc.The other nine cartoons, produced after 1953, are mostly decent cartoons in their own right, but are cropped to fill widescreen formats. Some of these crops are jarring, like ""Design for Leaving"" has parts of gags missing! These crops are not the intents of any the artists who worked hard to make these shorts.While Warner Bros. would eventually return to making all cartoons full frame for future compilations, the damage to this product line has been done. I rate it 2 stars because majority of the product has been fooled around with.Now that being said, I do need to draw attention to one cartoon in particular. ""Wise Quackers"" (full frame) from 1949 is easily the most controversial cartoon on this disc, with MANY gags cut out on television showings in the past.

If you are a fan of the classics Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Psycho, don't even bother wasting your time on Ed Gein. With a few quick edits, this could play on network television. There is absolutely NO shock value or gore. The director spends an inordinate amount of time illustrating Gein's relationship with different town members. This is so boring and no one cares! The fact that the man had SEVERED HEADS hanging from his door and dressed in a body suit of DEAD SKIN are just briefly passed over; and I mean briefly. The reason why people wanted to see a movie about Gein is to know the intimate and sick details of what he actually did to his victims. As a film, Ed Gein is so conservative that the most disturbing part is watching his mother and father gut one of the pigs on the farm. Railsback is decent as Gein but attention to detail is overlooked, like having his mom be rail \-thin when in reality she was heavy. The scene were he kills his older brother is pretty ridiculous too, complete with computer generated fire. All in all, I am still waiting for someone to have the guts to show what actually happened inside of that farmhouse.

777463,"The near future: Some young people deal with their disillusionment by participating in an illegal virtual reality war game.  Its simulated thrills and deaths are compulsive and addictive.  Some players, working in teams called &#8220;parties&#8221; even earn their living from the game.  The game is named after the legendary island where the souls of departed heroes come to rest: Avalon.  For Ash, an expert player, only 3 levels are left in order for her to conquer the game.  She usually plays solo but this time she knows she will need a partner because the levels are bound to get harder and harder&#8230;Sounds like a blast right?  A wet dream come true for sci-fi and cyberpunk fans?  So I thought but Avalon is nothing but one big snooze, a movie deceivingly packaged as something it&#8217;s not.  It started off on the right foot, with an intense 10-minute action sequence showing Ash blasting her way through one of the levels of the game.  After that it&#8217;s all downhill.  Between the first 10 minutes of action and the final 10 minutes of action, the movie veers towards emotionalism and existentialism that is not in the least interesting, the whole film moving at a snail&#8217;s pace.  Ok, so maybe Avalon was intentionally not meant to be a fast-paced action film but rather a character study about one of its players.  Problem is, Ash is not in the least bit an interesting character.  She is a withdrawn person who spends the whole time moping, feeling depressed and feeling sorry for herself.  We are never really told why she is such an unhappy person or where her single-minded obsession for the game originated from.It&#8217;s too bad because if it had been done right, Avalon could have succeeded, it does have a few good things going for it.  In true cyberpunk fashion, the city is presented to us, convincingly, as a bleak and fascist place.  When Ash does strap on to that reclining chair and puts on her game helmet (in a scene directly lifted out of The Matrix, which itself lifted the scene directly off Ghost in the Shell) the images are striking.  The game levels are a dream-like visual feast of decayed walled cities and those sets just brim with desolation and atmosphere.  But as I mentioned previously the first 10 minutes are like that, the last 10 minutes are like that and the rest is an insomnia cure about poor old pouting Ash.Don&#8217;t let the plot summary or box packaging fool you.  This film is not a virtual reality adventure.  It&#8217;s a joke. It&#8217;s such a shame too because I really love this type of movie.

162012,"This was a difficult film to review because although it is generally pretty bland there are some aspects I really liked and some I found awful.  Overall I couldn't give it more than 2 stars.Basically, it's a simple action picture about the America's Cup - good solid B-grade material.  The acting is passable, although the actors are weighed down with a terrible script that is full of cliches and stereotypes.  There is no imagination to the characterisation and the film never really engages the viewer.The scenes of sailing are, however, very well filmed and do capture the feeling of yacht racing, and the climax is suitably exciting and satisfying.  Unfortunately the rest of the film is so slow and so full of silly characters and dreadful dialogue that it makes the good bits hardly worth waiting for.But there is one great flaw in this film, and it is unforgivable.  A film such as this can contain fictional characters instead of the actual people who participated in the events, and it can even fictionalise events to a certain degree.  It is essential, however, that major events and characters are not altered because it is these that anchor the film to reality.  Change something important and the film becomes fantasy instead of adventure in an historical setting.For example, suppose the plot of Ron Howard's film ""Apollo XIII"" had the astronauts land on the moon and then the accident that crippled the ship occur on the return leg of the voyage.  The viewer would know that they were no longer watching historical drama, but science fiction instead.Well, that's what ""Wind"" does.  The director never seems to be able to decide whether they were creating a drama about the actual loss and subsequent win of the America's Cup by US teams in the 1980s, or whether they wanted to make a fictional story.For example, in early scenes the US syndicate boss is seen examining and lovingly touching a winged keel on their yacht - implying that it was a US invention.  In reality, it was the winged keel, invented by Australian Ben Lexcen, that was fitted to the Australian challenging yacht and contributed to her capture of the cup.  The America's Cup was also not lost due to a misjudged turn by the defending skipper, as the film implies - it was lost by 5 races to 4 due to the superior skills and technology of the Australian team.  The US boat was simply outraced.Similarly, the cup was won back by the US in the next race, but not by the use of a ""secret weapon"" spinnaker (illegal according to the rules anyway) or an innovative hull design, but simply by good sailing on the part of the US team.  The writers were so concerned with fabricating a love story and creating dramatic situations that they sacrificed the genuine drama and excitement of the race.  They made suspension of disbelief impossible by rewriting historical facts, and that's just plain bad film making.""Wind"" could have been so much more, and in the hands of a good director the flaws in the script could have been reduced, unfortunately Carroll Ballard was not up to the task.  Full marks to the cinematographer, however, for some spectacular shots of yacht racing.",N/A

attention.They find a pharmacy guarded by a cop.A struggle ensues between the guy and the cop,with the cop eventually being killed by his girl friend.We are shown a purple mark on the dead cops leg afterwards.Back at the house the two guys leave to steal a car,leaving the girl behind alone.However aliens soon enter the house and she is forced to flee.Outside an alien probe is just about to waste her when two soldiers destroy the probe.As they stand talking,the two guys show back up,unable to get a car,and the other one with his girlfriend.When a tramp sneaks up and grabs one of the soldiers sidearms,the soldiers are forced to shoot him.Unfortunately one of the guys is killed in the process.The remainder then drive to an ex black ops military man's house(Van Damme).He informs the group that he has a piece of alien technology and that he and his military bosses have for years suspected alien infiltrators,that look and talk like us.The only way of telling them from humans is a purple mark.The little girl then asks:&#34;Like the one on the policeman?&#34;.The ex ops man tells them to stick with only people they know.They all turn and look at the girlfriend  the guy picked up two nights before.The military guys want to search her but her boyfriend agrees to do it.Alone in the room she shoots him dead.The others come in and she manages to overpower them all and escape outside,where a probe beams her inside of it.More probes come and as the ex black ops man offers up his piece of alien technology to them,he is disintegrated.As the rest wait to be killed,suddenly other UFOs come out of the sky and attack the alien UFOs.Back inside the house with just the little girl,one of the guys, a military man left alive,and the other girl,the now apparent alien girl who was beamed into the probe,is now seen broadcasting on TV.She is saying the earth people have won the war and to remain inside.Just then an armed assault team enters the house saying there is a little girl that can identify them.The team then kills the rest of the survivors.Fade to black.The film doesn't give out with the answers and one is kind of left to fend for themselves,plot wise.The different attacking UFOs near the end is a puzzler.One can assume,though this is guessing,that they are earth made technology and that the military has been secretly waiting for just such an invasion to use them.The film goes along slowly but surely until the scene where they try and get the little girl into the pharmacy for some medical supplies.The producers seemed to have a lot invested in the fight scene that takes place.It goes on far too long,and the film thereafter seems to drag terribly.Jean Claude Van Damme's appearance is token at best,but he makes the best of what he has to do.He appears as this black ops guy who lives by himself.We first see him on the ground looking up from underneath a soldiers legs with a shotgun.&#34;And your name is?&#34;.And of course Van Damme gets to do some of his legendary box kicking with his own daughter Bianca Bree.However you almost laugh when Van Damme gets killed.Just before the alien probe disintegrates him he says&#34;Oh S#$!&#34;.It happens so quickly and is edited the same way,that I started to laugh a little when I saw it.Bianca,by the way,needs a LOT of more time on screen to develop some proper acting chops.Her brother seems to be doing fine,but she is FAR from a steady career in acting.How she got top billing is beyond me as her part,while not as limited in scope as her fathers,is truly one that goes in and out of scenes like a fly,and with limited lines.By the way the outer cover of this DVD,is a cheat.No man with such goggles,appears any where in this film.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette and a trailer.All in all another lame brained film,with a been-there done-that kind of plot;and done FAR better elsewhere.It uses cheesy and cheap S/FX,with that quick and supposedly edgy you-are-there camera work(ala The Blair Witch Project),and the plot gets quite ponderous and slow.Until this one gets into the $5.00 bin at Walmart,like the others from Phase Four I mentioned above,give it a pass.",Alien Uprising
282439,"The strengths of this Nutcracker can be summed up very simply: the dancing of Baryshnikov and Kirkland, which is to no one's surprise excellent and engaging. And there is some fine dancing from other members of the American Ballet Theater.However, if you're looking for a Nutcracker that will cause you to revel in the holidays as well as Tchaikovsky's glorious music, this isn't it.The sets by Boris Aronson range from a very ordinary parlor for Act 1 to a downright ugly fantasy candyland for Act 2. The costuming is second rate. The Chinese dancers don't look Chinese; the Russians don't look Russian. Other costuming seems cheap and uninspired. The general filming is too soft focus with not enough color contrast. And who's idea was it to have the ugly Act 2 thrones downstage blocking the action?From a choreographic standpoint, this is also a disappointing production.The children in Act 1 don't have much fun dancing and there are not enough of them. The adults don't act particularly well. It seems corners were cut in a lot of the dances in Act 2 which seem under populated and lacking in imagination and fire. You'd think the Russian dance in a Baryshnikov production would set your TV on fire; it is so tame and forgetable here. The Arabian dance is sadly missing altogether!The idea of having Drosselmeyer appear in the climactic Act 2pas de deux is a major distraction. He's simply out of place and adds no joy to the procedings. I'm sure this was meant as some deep psychological addition to the procedings, but it simply kills the moment and has nothing to do with the sublime music. And Act 2, which should end on a magical note, seems downright despressing in this production as Kirkland gazes out of a window like a lost soul???If you want to revel in Nutcracker as a holiday treat, you must turn to the glorious Balanchine version with the NYC Ballet (on DVD) which has Christmas and joy written all over it. Sumptuosly designed, filmed and cast, it should be your first choice. The ABT version can only serve a supplementary version for a serious collection.",The Nutcracker The American Ballet Theatre  VHS
1286350,"I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8"" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6"" apart. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.I have the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring from the early 1990's and thought it was time to upgrade with this Valencia Cycle.There has been enough said about the video aspect of these performances and the singers, but few details about the audio except that it is excellent. I beg to differ. I have listened to all 4 performances once and the Rheingold now twice for this review with the DTS HD-MA track.The orchestra is recorded fine. The sound stage goes about 2-3 feet beyond the front corner speakers to the left and right.EDIT: After listening to it again, the orchestra is also reversed in the surround mode. If you listen to the stereo track 2:55 into the recording, the french horns are on the left, where they are actually sitting. When you then listen to it in the surround mode, they come from the right, i.e reversed. END OF EDIT.The voices is another story.First, the left and right front stage microphones have been reversed. You can hear this clearly at about 18:15 into the performance. First sings the Rhine maiden in the middle and her voice comes from the center. Then sings the left maiden, but the sound comes from the right. Then sings the right maiden and the voice comes from the left. Never had anything like that.Most recordings try to have the voices go along with the singers, i.e. when a singer goes across the stage, the voice also goes across the stage. A few send the voices mostly through the center like Villazon/Machaidze's  Romeo and Juliet. Here the video direction centers the singers and it appears natural.In this Rheingold, the voices come mainly from about 2 feet to the left of the center with some strange anomalies.At 30:49 Wotan is left of Fricka, but Fricka's voice is left of Wotan.At 38:06 Fricka is on the far right of the stage, voice is from left.Whenever the action is on the right, the voices come from the left with few exceptions. But when the action is on the left, the voices come mostly from the left, too.But at 2:08:13 Fasold is on the left, his voice is in the middle.At 2:14:46 Fasold moved to the right, his voice is now left.At 2:17:15 Erda appears on the far left of the stage, but the sound comes from the right.At 2:21:05 Wotan to the right of Erda, his voice is left of her voice.The reversal of the stage microphones explains most of the anomalies, but not everything. Why not more sound from the right, when they are left.?Philipp Knop could probably tell us what went wrong. He is given credit for the stereo and surround mix.With the performance so much utilizing the projections in the background and wide stage shots required for that to work, the misallocation of the voices just ruins this for me. To see Wotan on the right and to hear him from the left is just goofy.If you watch it on a 32"" screen and your loudspeakers are 36"" apart, you probably won't notice. In my setting, very noticeable.The other 3 parts of the Cycle are essentially the same. EDIT: They are not the same and I'll review them separately. END OF EDIT.",N/A

877056,"Certainly this is cheap. Indeed you will save your money bigtime and you will have all 26 episodes. However, the quality of these episodes is very different from the episodes that ADV originally released, and not for the better. Pay no more attention to the advertising gimmick of the remastered video and jaw dropping 5.1 surround sound, because this is the first way that the series has been ruined in this format. All that has been changed is the sound effects are louder and at times the voices echo. On top of that, the 4 director's cut episodes have been redubbed, with a few characters voiced by completely different actors.The other problem with this item is that the pacing of nearly every episode has been changed. Where there were pauses in the older versions between dialogue, now there are none. The characters sound like they have been drinking too much coffee. Even though Ritsuko is bummed out in Episode 24, she is babbling like a baboon.  I suppose in order to fit 6 episodes on one disk, this must be done.Finally, there are no extras, none. The perfect collection which runs at about $130 contains character descriptions, Spanish and French language tracks, plenty more artwork on the covers and protect the discs much better than the flimsy, thin covers on these DVD's.

Peter Sellers' Clouseau was a very nuanced character, a man who may have been incompetent, but who went about his business very seriously. He realized when he made a mistake, and much of the humor arose for Clouseau's attempts to recover from his mistakes. Martin's Clouseau, by way of contrast, is simply a clown, who blunders through thinks completely unaware of the havoc he is creating, or of any of the effects of his actions. I suppose if you've never seen any of the original Peter Sellers films you might find Martin's slapstick enjoyable, but anyone who finds Sellers' Clouseau to be one of the great comic figures of film will find this movie (and its sequel) to be a huge disappointment.",N/A

A Trip to the Moon is on the disk twice, once in color and again in B&W.; There is a choice of two excellent  musical tracks on the B&W; films, but the color film only has one soundtrack. It is completely unidiomatic, has distracting mumbling voices, and it doesn't follow the action of the film. Worse yet, it omits Melies's own narration that is supposed to be part of the film.  Nothing makes sense without it. The cheezy synth music sounds like the loopy soundtrack to a 1970s mutton chop midget porn movie. The film is best watched with the volume turned down. The rest of the disk is filled out with a feature length documentary which is interesting, but I can't imagine watching it more than once.For a little more money you can get a five disk Flicker Alley DVD collection of Melies with dozens of great films, many of which are in even more beautiful color than this one.

352534,"Tous les Matins du Monde is one of those films you start off nodding approvingly: yes, this is going to be a good film. Yet as the film hits the 36-minute mark and Gerard Depardieu's narration still hasn't given way to the plot, you're not so sure. Alain Corneau is not short of ambition and nerve as a director, as his opening seven-minute close-up proves, but since abandoning the thriller genre for the arthouse he's no longer a natural storyteller or a particularly cinematic one for all the quality of the visuals. He's not helped here by not having much of a story to tell - the betrayal of violist Saint-Colombe by his pupil Marin Marais seems to exist largely for a final confrontation over the very nature of music that promises more than it delivers. Unfortunately, Jean-Pierre Marielle's excellent but appropriately one-note performance as the stern musician only able to really express his emotions through music tells us everything we need to know long before we reach that point.While the film is more illustrated lecture at times, the DVD is an altogether more successful affair - a fine letterboxed transfer and a strong selection of extras.",All the Mornings of the World Tous les matins du monde  VHS

The animation is very neat and looks great, but the cliched over the top ridiculous storyline and borderline terrible voice acting just about kills anything enjoyable with Golgo 13: Queen Bee.  The Queen Bee, a female guerilla renegade who seems to have sex with just about anything that moves, is really the main character here and Duke is in more of a supporting role.

1270396,"To begin with, I am an old fan of the original Land of the Lost TV series. I am also not a fan of Will Farrell. Yet I was willing to give this thing a chance. I almost wish I hadn't. The best thing I can say about the film is that it was not as bad as the reviews led me to believe. The fact remains that it is still a terrible film in almost every way.The cheesiest thing in the film was how they worked the original lyrics of the opening theme into the script and then later had Will Farrell sing a terrible version of it as if to slam us over the head that this was supposed to be based on a beloved television series. The overly-intelligent dinosaurs were an insult to the intellect of the viewer. The story of the rivalry between Enik and the Zarn seemed artificially grafted into the film instead of being an integral part of it. Personally, I was miffed that they made Enik a megalomaniacal villain (he was originally a neutral character helping the Marshalls for his own selfish but understandable reasons) and the Zarn into the victimized guardian. In fact, they completely changed the nature of the Zarn altogether (originally he was a being made of colored lights who was sensitive to human thought and emotion and was more neutral than evil).The story runs that disgraced physicist Rick Marshall has invented a machine which can open a doorway in time and space. A grad student named Holly convinces him to to build it and they use it to open a portal to the land of the lost, inadvertently taking a tour-guide biker named Will along with them. Once in the Land of the Lost, they rescue Chaka, a Pakuni prince, from being sacrificed by userpers of his throne. Rick Marshall acts superior to everyone and everything in this place, which pisses off Grumpy, the genius T-rex who, for some reason, understands English. We also have no good explanation why working with Chimps has made Holly fluent in Chaka's language. After lots of bad jokes based on the original series, they find the Lost City of the Sleestak. They included the message scrawled on one of the rocks ""beware of Sleestak"" from the original TV show without explaining it properly. They have been led here psychically by Enik who is trapped inside. Enik tells them that his people's mortal enemy, the Zarn, is planning a Sleestak invasion of Earth. Rick must find his device which was lost when they entered the Land of the Lost in order to defeat the Zarn and get home again. It just goes downhill from here. The film ends with Rick Marshall and Holly falling in  love, Rick Marshall making friends with Grumpy, the T-rex (Grumpy was grumpy because of an intestinal blockage. Don't ask how it gets fixed), and Will remaining behind with Chaka and his people. And the invasion, which is really being planned by Enik, is stopped.What really gets me is that the original television series has a number of episodes which could have been strung together and, with a bit of tweaking, become a nice two-hour film: The Marshall family is vacationing in the Grand Canyon when an earthquake accidentally opens a time doorway to the Land of the Lost. They make friends with Chaka who helps them get through the first few weeks of their exile. They discover the Pylons and the Lost City teeming with Sleestaks - and mabe have a run-in with Captain Colli and his canon, Sarah. Deep inside the Lost City they find Enik in his secure cave. He agrees to help them, but it is a trick. By falling into the Land of the Lost, they have caused a paradox. They go through the doorway, fixing the paradox and fall back into the Land of the Lost again. But all is not lost. Chaka takes Rick Marshall to see a special ritual performed by Ta, the Pakuni elder which opens a time dooway in one of the pylons. Rick Marshall steps inside, ignoring Chaka's attempts to stop him. Meanwhile, Holly and Will go out hunting for their dad only to be confronted by a ghostly image of Holly. The Ghost beckons them into a cave where they are forced to help alternate versions of themselves and their father who are stuck in a wall by completing a circuit of crystals in a matrix table. When the smoke clears, they find themselves outside with Chaka running to get them. They follow chaka to the Travelling Pylon just in time for the door to open and Rick Marshall to step out with the news that the pylon is their ticket home. Next morning, they get inside the pylon and the last part of the film includes a series of stops on alternate worlds and times. Finally, they climb out of the pylon in a remote part of the Grand Canyon. An old, wreck of a car leads them to believe that they are in the wrong place until around a corner comes a troup of tourists on the backs of donkeys. I would maybe include Mrs. Rick Marshall as well as a female guide for Will to ogle.The point is that this film should have been a reverent, serious sci-fi epic rather than a cheesy satire which puts down the original source material every chance it could get.Bottom line, I would not recommend this film to anyone.

Teamed with the Russian version of Laurel and Hardy, Ritchie and the group is trapped on an undeveloped floor with a psycho who is equally involved in LARPing, ballet, and murder.The most unfortunate aspect of Botched is the title describes the execution.  It's a poor attempt at the horror/comedy blend where the horror isn't scary and the comedy isn't funny.  Throw in disco lights and a few Scooby Doo chase scenes to make it worse.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention an atrocious, tone-def, misfiring score.  It's Addam's Family, carnival, Italian restaurant, Benny Hill, and Tetris theme song all rolled into one.  Worst score in movie history.For whatever reason the movie is set in Russia, where all of the actors aside from the perpetually dramatic Dorff butcher Russian accents filled with inaccuracies and inconsistencies.  Speaking of butchering, look for the Ed Gein inspired wallpaper midway through the film; it's the fraction that's even remotely creepy.  As for funny, there's a cheap fart scene.

660960,"There is nothing wrong with sweet movies.  I love sweet movies.  I love sweet, charming, affectionate movies that observe human nature through humorous and insightful lenses.  I saw just such a movie last year.  It was called ""Almost Famous.""If you haven't seen that particular title yet, you may have to after watching ""Chocolat;"" I can't think of a more appropriate way to wash out that synthetic aftertaste.  Movies like ""Chocolat"" aren't written or directed--they're engineered.Perhaps the finest chocolate requires an exact recipe, but provocative and entertaining cinema doesn't.  Just the opposite, really--great filmmaking resists formula.  But this inconsequential fluff piece, which imagines an insular French community where the transforming power of chocolate is enough to provoke life-changing epiphanies, is so blandly predictable, so precisely calculated to make you feel warm and fuzzy, that you almost wish--no, beg--for something unexpected and off-the-wall to happen.What makes ""Chocolat"" so easily digestible--and what led the Academy to idiotically award the film five undeserved Oscar nominations, aside from Miramax's relentlessly tacky advertising campaign--is the undeniable skill and craftsmanship in front of and behind the camera.  When you've got a director as respected as Lass Hallstrom and A-list talent like Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench, you can be sure it's all going to go down smoothly.  Gorgeous cinematography and sumptuous shots of melting chocolate certainly don't hurt.But when these ingredients are at the disposal of a script that relies so frustratingly on age-old conventions, a script that obliviously trots out the most pedestrian characters--and from the self-righteous mayor and the battered wife to the innocent boy with the domineering mother, they're all here--you have to wonder what the point of assembling all this talent is.  Binoche does absolutely nothing in this film to warrant her best actress nomination--nothing, perhaps, except to remind you that a long time ago she actually took on challenging roles.  Ditto Dench, who is such a towering performer that she shouldn't even be looking down her nose at a film like this.The fact that ""Chocolat"" paid off so handsomely for Miramax is disheartening indeed--not only because it cheated far superior movies of their just desserts, but because of the unavoidable suggestion that this film actually says something important.

I bear no malice against those with religious faith, although I do find it irrational and even harmful. With that out of the way, I must say I was very disappointed in THE GOD WHO WASN'T THERE. The content was just woefully lacking. More than an examination of the ""Jesus Myth Hypothesis,"" which I find very interesting, it is a simple critique on the practice of Christian religion, and a fairly unimaginative one at that. I was hoping for an entire movie dedicated to the astrological interpretation of the ""Jesus Myth"" explored in ZEITGEIST PART I, with some more evidence linking Jesus to other ""Sun Gods"" -- but there is none here. ZEITGEIST provided much more information and, sadly, is more professional, too. I watched this movie one time and then sold it.

The two love birds, Heathcliff (Robert Cavanah) and Cathy (Orla Brady) are myopic, narcissistic, manipulative, cruel and overall downright unlikable. What can you conclude about a guy whose only comment after his true loves death is, ""Did she mention me?""Final Thoughts: Beautiful cinematography, wonderful production values and attractive period costumes can't compensate for two main characters you just can't force yourself to care about.

Endless dark corridors don't automatically equate with horror, just unpaid electric bills.  And, as this was an illegal den of iniquity....I suppose everything came cheaply: the scientists/doctors and the research subjects (all disposable).  Since no one was worth saving, no need to care about any of the cast.  The story unfolds during a deposition, everything's already happened at that point so there aren't any surprises.  There's Ed Lauter as the mysterious head of this project (he's rarely onscreen).  He has a gun toting trigger happy henchman, Louis Mandylor (with an intermittent accent).  The rest of the cast is unknown and displays varying degrees of ability (from bad to worse).  Things only turned remotely interesting when the `Frankenstein' aspect of the story finally kicked in towards the end.  Otherwise, this type of story has been done better and often so there's really nothing here worth seeking it out.  Bland is the best term to describe this endeavor.",The Frankenstein Syndrome
37960,"I love the franchise but I have to vote this as the worst Nightmare on Elm Street film by far. Even the reboot was better. Freddy's Dead looked silly on release and it hasn't aged well at all. New Line had way too much fun with this one because it's not scary, well-acted, or funny and the special effects are atrocious (including the pointless 3D at the end). It brings a lame-brained plot twist of Freddy having a (previously unmentioned) daughter to carry on his legacy. The casting is the worst of the series and there are no romantic angles to engage viewers dramatically. The kids are very annoying (except Breckin Meyer) and they don't die. Lisa Zane almost saves it but there are way too many problems with makeup, special effects, editing and delivery. I like Yaphet Kotto but didn't appreciate him hitting Freddy with a baseball bat when he isn't the guy to play the ""Final Girl"" (WTF was he doing?). Adults don't normally fight Freddy aside from his getting burned in his own boiler. All the ideas in this film were quickly tossed in ANOES 7: New Nightmare and never returned. Parts 1-5 had a lot of continuity but this one asks the viewer for too much while delivering too little. It almost feels like it was made by a different studio because it's so strangely cobbled together. Admittedly, audience preferences were shifting but this entry was completely off the mark for what came before. Freddy's Dead introduced the ridiculous plot device of Freddy speaking straight into the camera (""It's travelling time!"") that was continued in Freddy vs. Jason (""No one is afraid of me anymore.). Since when do scary villains serve as the narrator? Freddy's makeup is ridiculous because you can see Englund is wearing a mask especially with the skin around his eyes poking out. Even great cameos from Johnny Depp, Alice Cooper, Roseanne, and Tom Arnold can't save it. The ending feels like a friendly reunion that lacks punch and almost destroyed the franchise completely. The ending of Part 3: Dream Warriors was much more fitting for a conclusion to the series. Amazon reviewers give this a lowly 3 star rating.ANOES fans should check out the much better films included in theA Nightmare on Elm Street Collection (All 7 Original Nightmare Films + Bonus Disc) [Blu-ray].",N/A

1178726,"If you were like most who enjoy horror movies, you probably looked forward to The Strangers like a kid on Christmas day, running down to a living room filled with brightly wrapped presents and a dazzilingly lit tree. What you probably didn't expect when you opened your expensive looking box was a handful of gravel and the smell of cat urine. That pretty well describes the disappointment that you'll feel with The Strangers, one of the greatest previews ever made.The premise is straightforward. A couple recently returned from a wedding, and reeling from a refusal of marriage, stops at a remote house for the night. What was supposed to be sunshine and romance is instead an awkward and drawn out shuffle of two people who can barely stand to look at one another. Then a knock at the door, a woman looking for her friend Tamara, which sets off a series of startle scares and repititous spooky scenes, as the couple are set upon by three masked assailants.The let downs begin with the characters themselves, who apparently barely made it out of the 3rd grade. While many people bemoan the stupidity of characters in slashers, these two hopeless souls and their erstwhile allies are so mind boggingly inept that its a wonder the villians don't leave them in peace. Hunters want prey, and tormenting Tyler and Speedman was about as challenging as kicking a pair of still blind puppies.The set is spooky, though lighting and setup make for some poorly shot scenes. Overall, it was a great design for a slasher pic, though it was poorly handled. The sound and dialogue are okay, and the costumes for the villians are definitely unsettling given their relative passivity. You don't expect Pikachu or Hello Kitty to try and drive a knife into your guts.The story line is rather fast paced, and there are some very spooky moments, the majority of which you saw in the trailer, but expectations were far higher for this piece, and it ends up being a remake of Friday the 13th, an empty slasher following people with more alcohol in their system than brains, with a disappointing, predictable ending and a hollow message of evil wearing many faces.",N/A

683523,"Very disappointing, esp. compared to the director's previous film, ""Run Lola Run.""This one is slow and tediously artsy/psychological, requiring monumental suspension of disbelief throughout...full of simply preposterous things like security guards who are unable to shoot and in fact are disarmed by the protagonists calmly approaching them with a ""you couldn't really kill a human being, could you?"" rap.  This is like the kind of egregiously bad film you'd expect from someone in their first semester of film school and devoid of a decent producer and film editor to trim off all the suffocating fat.  Methinks Tykwer may've gotten a bit too cocky after the success of ""Run Lola Run.""The camera work and cinematography is arresting from time to time, but there are way too many lingering closeup shots of the main characters looking troubled, experiencing DEEP EMOTIONS, pondering and pondering (what?  their next bowel movement, perhaps---in classical European style their expressions certainly have a please-somebody-give-me-some-ExLax quality to them).Franka Potente plays the most popular nurse in a mental hospital who spends most of the movie trying to get to the mysterious man who saved her life after an accident that he caused, and like her Mystery Man also has plenty of deep dark secrets of her own but not quite as Byronic as Mystery Man's own of course.In the end we see the redeeming and transformative power of love do its work on the poor guy but not really---the character development is very very thin which makes the characters' actions even less believable than the story already is.I suppose what the old saw that every writing teacher loves is also apropos to film-making: SHOW, not tell.  This film only does the latter, despite it being a very SHOW-friendly medium, hence as a film it is a complete dud.  It self-consciously aims for mythic signficance (see the title) but achieves the entertainment level of a mediocre made-for-TV movie at best.",The Princess and the Warrior

643863,"Those of you hoping for big laughs like scary movie 3 gave will be greatly disappointed, the gags are stale, the delivery of jokes is off and leslie neilson just isn't funny anymore. Some of the actual films scary movie 4 spoofs are the obvious War of the Worlds, Saw and the Grudge plus other films The Village, Brokeback Mountain and even Million Dollar Baby.  I think that Proft, Zucker and Abrahams dropped the ball there with the original idea that the Wayans brothers had to spoof just horror or thriller films. Even in Scary Movie Three they spoofed 8 Mile, The Matrix although funny, inconsistant with the original formula.  Some of the Dialogue was tired as well, especially when anna faris says she saw some Pictures of Bill Pullmans character in which he replies, 'I was young I needed the work' same dialogue used in the Naked gun between Priscilla Presley and Leslie Neilson.However the biggest jab in the film was at President Bush when leslie Neilson as the President learns that the world is under attack by aliens, he is seated in front of a grade school class and just sits there more concerned about the story being read aloud by one of the students.  Well done.  When I say some of the gags are stale they're really stale, Like Carmen Electra as the blind girl from the Village sitting on an open storage bench Going to the bathroom, with about twenty seconds of gratuitious Flatulance, done better in other films like Not another Teen Movie and Harold and Kumar go to WhiteCastle. Scary Movie 4 also seems to capitolize on  something they did in Scary Movie 3...accidental clumsy personal injury. People bumping their heads repeatedly in the same place. Various objects falling on people, People getting hit by cars and doors.  All that is repeated in SM4 and goes overboard.  This Movie does have some laughs, like the opening sequence with Shaquille O'neal and Dr. Phil...thats funny. But the rest of the film the laughs are few and far between.Anna Faris reprises her role as Cindy Campbell..always a pleasure. and Regina Hall is back as Brenda even though her character keeps dying in each film. I just hope this writing team doesn't have any plans for a fifth installment.Bottom Line.......Frankly I was bored with it, the laughs didn't come fast enough or at all.

It's not tongue-in-cheek enough to be campy, and it's not subtle enough to be satire. It was impossible for me to suspend my disbelief and swallow the idea that this was happening in a far future devastated by nuclear warfare. I expected that at any given moment the camera would turn and reveal the entire film crew, complete with the director wearing a hawaiian shirt, sitting in his chair under a beach umbrella, and sipping a fancy cocktail. I couldn't care about any of the characters. The beginning animations were interesting enough, but after about 20 minutes it disintegrated towards total boredom. I couldn't last past 45 minutes.

884379,"I agree with other reviewers when they say that Clive Owen, nasty as his character is, is the only thing vaguely remarkable about this depressing, senseless film.What is this movie trying to be? It's all about raunchy talk and twisted sexual innuendos and allusions and yet there's nothing really even approaching sex between the characters. The best I can figure is that the two leading ladies are prudes at heart. If a person wants to watch porno, obviously they can, but this movie needed to put a little bit more of its money where its mouth is if we're to get a feel for the deeper reality of the characters. All I came away with was a bad taste in my mouth from watching three and a half (Portman isn't quite as repugnantly immoral) backstabbers from hell. Law and Roberts deserve something horrid to befall them; what a couple of childish, lying, selfish monsters. Why would Owen want Roberts back the third time, simply revenge? At least his character was almost believable as some obsessive macho type with a bit of a (twisted) mind. Can't quite buy him as a doctor, though.I also definitely couldn't buy Portman's sudden about face with regard to Law at the end. Nobody who truly loves somebody as much as she supposedly loves Law could instantly and utterly write them off for simply wanting to know the truth. I couldn't really buy Portman in this role in general, actually. She seems like some kind of bleeding heart, Ivy League ______ Princess type in real life and I think that her playing a vagabond/stripper, no nudity mind you, is just one of those things actors try to do to show off their ""range"". I can't see her as anything other than Natalie Portman in anything she has yet played. She was promising in ""The Professional"" but has since never even matched her work in that film from the early 90s. I can't say I really get Roberts as a heartbreaker either. She has a unique look and vibe, but nothing to launch a thousand ships or drive a man to threatening murder.

1121458,"The Beatles, the Vietnam war, star crossed lovers and show-woman Julie Taymor.  That is what `Across the Universe' brings to the table.  It doesn't always work and yet it is never less than intriguing.Using Beatles songs as jump off narratives for plot shifts, Taymor wraps her `Shakespearian' tale around a poor artist from Liverpool who travels to America and falls in love with a girl out of his league and mourning the loss of her beloved (who died in the war).  Together they make an odd pair, born more out of division than unity (their style, taste and political aspirations all stem from separate places) and yet the stars have aligned and shown them the light.  Musically, it doesn't always work.  It seems a little too all over the place and other than Sturgess and the dynamic Dana Fuchs, the vocals don't always deliver the goods.That said, it is a lovely looking film (the art direction is stunning and those costumes are spot on) and it has a central flow that keeps one glued, but it doesn't always make it's point quite how it wants to, and the interwoven storylines (especially concerning Prudence and Sadie) don't add anything to the film...in fact they tend to take away.  Taymor has an issue with overthinking her productions.  She creates truly grandiose looking vehicles (you can add this in with `Titus' as one of the prettiest feature films in recent memory) and yet they are hollow, forgettable almost.  She hasn't figured out how to incorporate her obvious talent for window-dressing into a film that has substance.  Oh, and the special effects here are somewhat atrocious.

I mean, you've got a standup comic (Tree) dressed up as a  psychotic killer clown menacing three teenage boys with his two equally psychotic associates. It's a late-eighties horror flick. I mean, how bad can it be?Well, the answer is, pretty bad. And as much as the recent rash of email chain letters attempting to get Salva's  films boycotted drives me to want to contribue to Salva's coffers, I'd rather watch Powder for twenty-four hours back-to-back than sit through this dog again. Salva enjoys descending  into the realm of teen sex comedy humor all too often, including the inevitable masturbation jokes.

898294,"I will state flat out that I truly disliked this film, the plot, the music, and the directorship.  As a fan of western films, I highly anticipated watching this one, but was sorely disappointed on so many levels.  The plot has so much potential, but in my view, it is wasted, and the film drifts like a vessel which has lost its rudder.  The film boasts an all-star cast in Heston, Hutton, Harris, Coburn, Ben Johnson, and many others, but even with this great talent, the film is so disjointed and confusing, even this all-star cast cannot save it.  The battle scenes are perhaps the worst element of the film.  The scenes are shot primarily at night so it is hard to clearly see the action, and then there are so many brief shots pieced together that one cannot possibly determine who is shooting who, who got hit, or even who is winning the battle.  I suppose battles are like this in reality, but these are perhaps the worst battle scenes I have ever seen in a movie.  The musical score is inappropriate at times, and at other times downright annoying. I'd rather hear nothing than this drab score.Director Sam Peckinpah had a lot to work with in terms of script and cast, but in my view he completely mismanaged both.  Major Dundee is a major disappointment.  While others rate this western in their top-25 list of all-time greats, it does not even budge the arrow on my Richter Scale.kone",N/A
1318857,"""True Blood"" sucks. Season 3 sucks most of all. And not in a sexy, vampire-sucking kind of way. It sucks as in it BLOWS CHUNKS.I'm sorry. I know there are a lot of die-hard fans of this show out there, and I do not mean to offend, but in my opinion, this show has really tanked. I think the Sookie Stackhouse books are terrible, so it doesn't surprise me that I don't like the show. However, I thought Season 1 was a vast improvement over the book, and then Season 2 went downhill really fast, and Season 3 is so bad it's ridiculous. The plots are stupid, the characters are all over the place, and it's just painful to watch.I think the season finale was a major letdown and the way Eric, Bill, Pam, and Sookie dealt with the whole Russell situation was just plain idiotic. We all know Sookie has zero brain cells in her gap-toothed head, but surely Eric and Pam could have been able to come up with a better plan. PLEASE! Jason is usually one of the only tolerable characters on the show, but he was stuck with that annoying Crystal chick all year, which was a total bust. I've hated Tara since Season 2, which is a shame since she started off as a decent character, but these days I just want to slap her. (At least she chopped off that nasty hair at the end of the season.) Then there's Sam...I don't even know where to begin. A few episodes before the finale, everything about Sam's past took on a crazy new dimension, and it just made no sense at all.The only good think about Season 3 is that women were treated to a few Eric butt shots, which was a refreshing change since the gratuitous nudity on this show is generally 90% female.Aside from Eric's backside, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SHOW IS STUPID! Why, when HBO created masterpieces like ""The Sopranos,"" ""Sex and the City,"" and ""Six Feet Under"" (another Alan Ball show, only decent) did the network decide to crank out this garbage?!

Also appearing is George `Anything for a Buck' Kennedy (The Dirty Dozen, Cool Hand Luke), Andrea Occhipinti (Conquest), Ana Obreg&oacute;n (Monster Island), and Olivia d'Abo (Conan the Destroyer, ""The Wonder Years""), in one of her first roles.Bo Derek plays Ayre `Mac' MacGillivery, a woman who (get this) is preparing to graduate from an English college and once she does, she'll trade in her diploma for a vast inheritance.  Once that happens she plans to travel the world and learn the ways of love because, as you see, she's still a virgin.  Okay, wait a minute...Bo's pushing thirty and she's just graduating from college?  I can buy off on that, but I'm having a much harder time with the notion she's untouched, I mean seriously...anyway, after seeing one too many Valentino films (the film is supposed to be a period piece, set in the early 20th century I guess), Mac hits the road with her trusty chauffeur Cotton (Kennedy) and college friend Catalina aka `Cat' (Obreg&oacute;n), the trio heading towards the Middle East as Mac thinks it would be the ginchiest to get bagged by a real, honest to goodness sheik.  After a failed attempt (the sheik got stoned on magic smoke and passed out, but not before covering a nekkid Derek in warm honey), Mac, with entourage in tow, makes her way to Spain with the intent on hooking up with a handsome matador, and she finds one named Angel (Occhipinti), who, when not faux fighting bulls or shagging fourteen year old gypsy girls produces wine, and lots of it.  With the help of Angel's tagalong gypsy girl named Paloma, played by Ms. d'Abo sporting a ridiculous Spanish accent, Mac worms her way into Angel's bed after agreeing to use her vast fortunes to buy his wine, the deal sealed with a good shagging (I find Spanish business negotiations quite agreeable).  Following this there's some more idiocy, capped off by Angel getting his doodle gored by a bull, and now unable to perform, much to Mac's dismay (no more zoom zoom in the boom boom).  So anyway, while Cat's getting friendly with Mac's kilted Scottish lawyer and Cotton gets his groove on with Angel's sassy cook, Mac tries to draw Angel from his depressed funk in the hopes she'll be able to cure his condition by prancing around his room nekkid.  When not sadistically teasing a man who can't perform, Mac begins taking up bullfighting for some odd reason or another.Okay, I first saw this film back in the mid 1980s on cable I was in the hormonally charged state of a teenager coming into his own, so my main focus was obviously on Derek's nekkidness, of which there's quite a bit.  After watching this film again some twenty years later, I find I still enjoy the nekkidness, but I have to say the rest is probably one of the more ridiculous efforts I've seen in a long time.  I think the intent was to create a rich, erotic drama, but the film fails miserably mainly for the fact Bo Derek cannot act, at least not enough to carry a film.  She's certainly attractive, but her ditz factor is incredibly high, not helped any by her husband's completely rotten and moronic scripting (the film comes off like a poorly written Harlequin romance novel).  Speaking of her husband, how creepy is that, knowing he wrote and directed the film, especially given the sequences where his wife is getting it on with other guys (he filmed her in some equally steamy sequences in the 1981 moron-a-thon Tarzan, the Ape Man)?  The man was pushing sixty at the time (while Bo wasn't quite yet thirty), so the maybe wedding tackle didn't function the way it used to which resulted in his willingness to let his wife dally about on screen with other men (a couple of the intimate sequences looked pretty realistic)...I don't know, but whatever...a good part of the story has Bo's character talking about her virginity like it was some sort of gift she was willing to impart, which, after awhile, got really old (at least she didn't refer to it as her `flower, but she did refer to it as `her fruit' at one point), which ends, mercifully, after she gets her shag on with Angel.  As far as the rest of the cast they didn't fare much better.  George Kennedy seemed kind of lost, hanging about to pick up a check and see some nekkid broads I suppose, and Olivia d'Abo appeared simple-minded as the young gypsy girl stuck on Angel (eventually she gives way to Mac as she realized she couldn't compete).  One of the biggest mysteries for me, besides the actual point of the film, is why it ran an hour and forty-five minutes.  Once you get by the juicy stuff (the attractive people being a nekkid), the rest just drags under the unbearable weight of its' own harebrained idiocy.  Perhaps the funniest scene in the film comes near the end, as Mac and Angel are getting it on (seems Mac's desirability is such that it can cure a broken doodle) and they're transported to, get this, a smoke-filled plane of reality.  Right in the middle of their routine a large, purple neon sign appears behind them spelling out the word EXTASY, as if to really bring it home (yeah, I know it's spelled wrong but that's how it was in the film, intentionally so).  All in all if you're looking to see Ms. Derek in the raw, then this film is right up you alley as she's got about five or six scenes, but if you're looking for anything remotely resembling an actual movie (plot, interesting and engaging characters, etc.), best to keep on looking.The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, does looks clean and clear, and the Dolby Digital Stereo Surround audio comes through well.  As far as extras there isn't much except for a theatrical trailer and subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.Cookieman108By the way, did I mention how creepy (and skeevy) I found it for a man to write and direct a film featuring his really hot wife enjoying the pleasures of other men?

646392,"Brian de Palma has never been the most gifted of filmmaker's but he's crafted some pretty good stuff, namely Carrie, Dressed to Kill and The Untouchables, but what we have here is a dismal excuse for a movie that considering the incredible source material, falls not only flat on its face but manages to go subterranean.  The Black Dahlia (a.k.a Elizabeth Short) murder is one of the most iconic and fantastic of unsolved murder mysteries of the 20th century and one deeply rooted in the allure and myth of old Hollywood.  This kind of fodder in the right hands could have yielded extraordinary results, but de Palma seems to have no idea not only how handle the material but how to induce the slightest bit of interest in anyone associated with it.  Every single actor seemed not only bored but downright annoyed, with Hilary Swank (a consistently gifted actress) hamming it up in the femme fatale role of socialite, Madeleine Linscott.  The plot is contrived beyond salvation; ideas and themes thrown in at break-neck speed but in the end not amounting to anything.  There's plenty of conjecture but little proof or finality, so, in the end, who cares? Yes, the film is visually appealing and attention to detail is in full evidence, but that's about it.  Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart and Scarlett Johansson just lie as still as swamp water and even the score by the usually reliable Mark Isham fails to create a sense of time and place.  Believe it or not, the best performance was given Mia Kirshner in the role of Betty Short, who, incidentally, has about a total 10 minutes of screen time and all through screen test films.  With minimal time, she manages to not only humanize a very sensational story but to convey the tragedy that struck this young woman 60 some odd years ago.  Those expecting anything similar to L.A. Confidential or any other film noir masterwork (I did, based on the fact that both novels were written by James Ellroy...big mistake) will be disappointed beyond words.  This is a very pathetic effort, indeed.  What made it doubly annoying was just how much I was looking forward to seeing it.",The Black Dahlia

181724,"I have followed Spinal Tap very sporadically over the years, mostly since their buzz after the release of this film (I honestly remember hearing very little about them during the seventies).  After viewing this documentary, I believe the filmmaker could have done better both in his editing choices and his choice of bands.While Spinal Tap is capable of turning out the occasional catchy tune, it's obvious watching this film that they were/are basically one-trick ponies.  Whether that's the fault of the editor, I can't say.  I will say that viewing this film made me only want the hits (collected on the film's soundtrack) and it did not give me the desire to seek out their earlier work (&quot;Shark Sandwich&quot; and &quot;Intravenous De Milo&quot;, both of which seem to be out of print anyway).I guess my real complaint is with the filmmakers, as I'm wondering why they chose to cover such a little-known group when there were perfectly acceptable alternatives: Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Eddie Money, and/or Motorhead.  Spinal Tap may have been an interesting story, but they're hardly a band worth making immortal through film.",This Is Spinal Tap
9295,"In 2005, we took a weekend trip from Baton Rouge, LA to Natchitoches, LA, where fifteen years earlier the filming of Steel Magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened. Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the ""cutest"" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough ""cute"" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in ""Hitch"". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One ""Hillbillies-like"" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some ""crows"" out of a tree so that they won't ""**** all over the reception"". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.Sad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. There was also some choppiness between scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.Dolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.The movie improved from the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).Overall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene.",Steel Magnolias VHS

1178545,"Part of Ghost House Underground collection, Trackman (2007) is a slasher film shot in Russia (CCCP), and dubbed in English.  While the language barrier contributes to the film having poor dialog and kind of a rough edge, the major problem is the uneven pacing, and underdeveloped storyline.  Way too much time is spent establishing a creepy ""atmosphere"", before the level of action finally ramps up in the third act.Trackman starts out with some promise, as a man named Splint recruits three criminal types to carry out his plan to rob a bank.  Unfortunately things do not go as planned, and some soldiers in the bank are killed.  After grabbing some cash, the three bank robbers each grab a hostage, and escape down into a system of underground tunnels.  The plan is for the three robbers, Grom (Dmitri Orlov), Kirk (Oleg Kamenshchikov), and Kostya (Tomas Motkus), to rendezvous with Splint underground, and then make their escape.  Two of the hostages, Olga (Yuliya Mukhailova) and Katya (Svetlana Metkina) are bank employees, and the third is a police sergeant (Aleksandr Vysokovskiy).For about 40 minutes, the film follows the group as they wander noisily through the tunnel system, which lucky for them is fairly well lighted.  Along their journey, there are brief shadowy glimpses of the Trackman, a masked figure with goggles, carrying a pickaxe, reminiscent of the killer in My Bloody Valentine.  When Splint is found dying, with his eyes gouged out, the group realizes that they are not alone.  When a strange mist conveniently appears in the tunnel, it is finally time for the Trackman (Aleksey Dmitriev) to swing his pickaxe.After this, the pace begins to pickup, and the herd is thinned down a bit.  Things get more interesting, when the Trackman sets his sights on Katya, and tries to strangle her long distance using a cord.  Grom manages to save her, and they barely manage to crawl to safety.  Somehow the Trackman remains close behind, and even engages in a little gunplay, before whipping out of all things, his trusty flamethrower!  Grom and Katya battle the Trackman at his hideout, which soon becomes an inferno, bringing this unlikely adventure to a fiery conclusion.Trackman gets off to a decent start, but quickly looses momentum, dragging on for far too long before it finally gets going.  Even after the action ramps up, most of what occurs is pretty ridiculous, such as when Katya shows no damage after hitting her head with a pipe.  Other strange events are not explained, like how does a motorcycle get stuck on the ceiling of the tunnel, and then somehow get back down again?  Still, the action scenes in the final act are decent enough to keep the film from being a complete waste of time.  Trackman is a fairly robotic killer, who doesn't speak.  He usually moves at a snail's pace, but occasionally is capable of bursts of speed.  Character development in general is very shallow, with the dialog mostly consisting of senseless chatter, or people giving commands or making threats.  The tunnel settings are very inconsistent, and the structure varies widely.  About the only constant are the narrow tracks for mining carts, that run through the tunnels.  Walking through the mud, the cast manages to remain remarkably clean.There aren't any spectacular kills, and the characters and killer aren't particularly interesting, so Trackman might be best suited to slasher enthusiasts.  The movie is disjointed, inconsistent, unpolished, and loses something in the translation, but it does have pretty decent production values, and a few scary moments and well shot scenes.",N/A
535908,"Let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this is a good movie. The follow-up to the critically successful ""Silence of the Lambs,"" is a meager attempt at best. I guess the problem stems from the fact that the novel was not that good. ""Shock value"" and ""tasteless"" are a few words that come to mind. In a movie with such great talent and a pretty good director, you would hope that the movie would succeed where the novel failed, but that was not the case.What intrigued me about the first film was the everlooming presence of Anthony Hopkins. Behind the glass cage, you sensed the danger in his character. In this film, he's all over the place. Now, he's just an old guy that's walking across the street. They tried humanizing him, trying to give him more emotions to work with, which was a mistake, since at face value, Anthony Hopkins looks like one of your dad's older friends - harmless - instead of the psychopathic killer we'd expect from him. His presence is gone. Now we know why he's a psychopathic killer; ...Honestly, the only thing that kept me awake in the film are the over the top gross out scenes we'd expect from a bad ""Nightmare on Elm St."" film. If this film didn't receive the NC-17 rating for violence, I don't know what will.Still, Anthony Hopkins gives a great performance. That's about it.",N/A

136784,"A particular Elvis fan favorite? C'mon! I'm a huge Elvis fan, but this lousy film is in no way better than his previous films, except for the aspect of eye candy for the guys...in the form of Ann Margret. She is definitely the star of this movie, and it's quite obvious that the director purposely exploited Margret's beautiful face and figure to overcompensate for the terrible script. It starts off interesting enough, albeit quite corny in places (especially in the songs), but I expected that and accepted it for what it was. However, the story just gets weaker and weaker, until the end where the time span between the climax and the end of the movie is about 30 seconds. And absolutely no twists or turns in the plot to make it interesting...just blah, the end. Just an awful movie, sorry.I really like Jailhouse House and King Creole--those were great flicks, and not just compared to Elvis's other movies.

Rather the atmosphere is harsh overall.  The ill-directed actors show no acquaintance or even what I would rate as professional sympathy with their assigned characters.  Despite the high reputations of several of the actors, their performances here are perfunctory and wooden.  Now, of course Japanese roles are often seeming much more austere that Western ones, but here the margin is too great for comfort or enjoyment or edification.  The whole product is too cool for its own good: more like a Noh theatre performance of stylized gestures, and shouting taking the place of acting. If you want to see true Japanese families, who show traditional poise and yet operate with what all families must share in terms of care, affection and natural human warmth....look to Ozu's masterworks instead of here (or Naruse or better yet the recent ""Departures"").

757239,"Summary:Aaron Hallam (Benicio Del Toro) is a U.S. military trained killer.  That's all fine and dandy until the killing becomes more than second-nature to him; it becomes his first nature and he can't seem to stop doing it, even when he isn't on assignment.  His urge to kill is so powerful that he ends up butchering some deer hunters.The F.B.I. are called in and they turn to the man who happened to train Aaron, L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones), to catch him and/or stop him.  L.T. agrees and does find him but nearly dies in the process, only to be saved by the person in charge of the F.B.I. contingent on the case, Abby Durrell (Connie Nielsen (I)), who tranquilizes Aaron at the last possible moment before he kills L.T.Aaron is then taking into custody only to escape and lead Aaron on a hunt through Portland and eventually back into the forest where L.T. finally catches up to him for their final showdown with knives.My Comments:I had the conception that this movie was going to be something like a Rambo remake with a U.S. special forces operative going a little haywire and wanting to either be left alone or kill everyone.  Well, it is pretty similar except in this movie the Rambo character, Aaron, isn't really provoked and ends up dying at the hands of his trainer instead of giving up to his trainer.  So, the idea isn't really all that original.  There is, however, one element of the movie that is original which is why I gave it two stars instead of one, but I'll get to that in a minute.As for the story, it's horrible.  There is an attempt to explain why Aaron went crazy - he saw too much violence in Kosovo and snapped.  But there is no attempt to explain how he ended up in the forest in Oregon nor is there any connection drawn between him being in the forest and him killing the hunters.  There is an attempt to humanize Aaron, by having him threaten to reveal top secret information and also having him meet up with a woman and her daughter, but both of these are quickly dismissed for what seems to be the primary focus of the movie - knife fights and L.T. tracking Aaron.  Dismissing the potentially interesting subplot of Erin wanting to expose the U.S. governments top secret assassination operations was the wrong thing to do, it gave Aaron a better motivation for the killings then just being psycho.  It also isn't really explained why L.T. never replied to Aaron's letters nor why he quit training killers in the military; a lot goes unexplained in this movie and it could have been much better.As for the story we see in the movie, it just gets worse.  At least 1/2 of the movie is just L.T. tracking Aaron until they finally meet up for the 25 minute knife fight by a waterfall.  Along the way Aaron does some pretty silly things, like climbing a bridge tower instead of just diving off into the water or even getting on the subway in the first place.  Aaron also seems to lose L.T. about a million times only for L.T. to suddenly find him again without any explanation.  Then, of course, the F.B.I. has to choose not to listen to L.T. and spends most of the second half of the movie combing the river and river banks looking for Aaron only to somehow become informed of the final confrontation taking place and arrive just in time to watch it end.  How they became informed of the fight is beyond me.There are no plot twists, though I'm guessing that the truck accident was supposed to be one but anyone with half a brain could have seen that coming.  And, frankly, the movie is pretty boring.  What's more, when you watch the special features afterwards you realize that most knife fights last all of 20-30 seconds before one of the combatants is dead or dying.  For some reason the fights between  Aaron and L.T. last forever.  It was wholly implausible, but I guess a 20 second fight scene wouldn't be as fun to watch, thus the extended fight sequences.  The story, as a whole, is pretty bad.  Even the ending is kind of lame.As for the acting, it wasn't too bad.  Both Benicio del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones are good, but they are the only ones worth mentioning.  I'm thinking that in the original script Abby Durell was supposed to have a bigger part, but for some reason she is really limited to just being L.T.'s sounding board when he isn't chasing or fighting Aaron.  As for the rest of the actors, they were pretty much knife fodder for Aaron and didn't need to be good, so they weren't.The one original thing I felt the movie did was introduce the audience to a new form of knife fighting.  The fighting choreography was actually pretty interesting and fun to watch, though it did tend to get a bit carried away.  I gave the movie an extra star just for trying something new.Overall, this is really just a slightly modified remake of Rambo with a different ending, and, sadly, that's about all.  If you've seen Rambo and liked it, you probably won't really want to see this because it might corrupt your vision of a great movie.  Of course, on the other hand, if you didn't like Rambo, you probably won't like this movie because it is pretty much a copy cat.  So, if you didn't see Rambo, you may want to give this one a try.  As I said, the knife fighting is pretty interesting and some of the special features that come on the DVD are good additions.  But as a story, I think the director, William Friedkin, probably ruined this by focusing so much on specific locations instead of telling a compelling and interesting story.  I don't recommend this movie (and I like special ops/action/war movies).",N/A

When I finally had the opportunity to watch The Hobbit, I was very disappointed; I was confused by how disjointed the movie is. It starts out as sort of a Hobbit: The Musical and introduces us to the main cast of characters, none of whom really distinguish themselves enough for me to identify their personalities. The adventure has a slow start and never gained enough steam to keep me interested. Even the special effects, which were so seamless in the LOTR trilogy, didn't have the same quality. I have not read Tolkein's The Hobbit, so maybe I would have enjoyed this movie more if I had, but I hadn't read The Fellowship of the Ring when I first saw that adaptation, and was able to love it.

913993,"THE BROWN BUNNY is full of emotion.  The slow pace sometimes harms the movie.  But at times, the snail's pace lets the viewer absorb what is happening and digest it, letting the emotion of the movie bloom in full.The movie works best as a road trip film.  I enjoyed going across the country with Vincent in his van.When it came time for various characters to sit around talking to each other, I started to tune out.  None of the characters were nearly as interesting as the American landscape as seen from Vincent's van windows.  Yet the only dialog scene that brought the movie to a dead stop was the scene with the grandparents (and the title bunny).  It actually took awhile for me to get back into the movie after an eternity of sitting around the kitchen table with these elderly people who had nothing to say.  I wish this scene had been cut out entirely, or at least trimmed to a quarter of it's current length.I did enjoy the interaction with Daisy at the end of the movie.  And the controversial oral sex scene did not disrupt the film for me... it just seemed like what those two characters would do at that point in the story.  It did not de-rail the film and it was refreshingly honest.Though not really pulled off with a lot of filmmaking expertise, I did like what the final (flashback) scenes of THE BROWN BUNNY were trying to say.Gallo's DIY filmmaking is wonderfully daring, but I wish he would let others in on the process from time to time.  I appreciate the freedom he has as an artist, but perhaps surrounding himself with more crew would add more quality to his film.

916896,"This was such crap! I quote my buddy David Long when he says, ""This must have been a conspriracy against the guys drafted from RAW!"" And yes ALL OF THEM, including Randy Orton (and I'll explain later)...well here we go...Match #1 MNM (c) vs. Animal and Heidenreich for the WWE Tag Titles: OMG, WHAT A LET DOWN! Animal and Heidenreich pull out the win after the Dooms Day Device on Mercury!!! What a bunch of crap! Animal will not be around that long, he is only here to promote the DVD...and Heidenreich...UGH! Hopefully MNM gets these back at Summerslam! 6/10 for Animal's tribute to Hawk at the end!Match #2 Christian vs. Booker T: First instance in a RAW drafted superstar getting the hose down! Christian was being pushed like a dream on RAW, now he is reduced to two huge loses since coming to Smackdown! He should have won the #1 Contenders match and been in the main event with Batista! A decent wrestling match where Book finishes Christian off with a scissor kick off the second rope! 7/10Match #3 Orlando Jordan (c) vs. Chris Benoit for the US Title: Ok I could rant all day long here!!! But I'll try to keep it to a minimum...Anyways, Jordan is a horrible US champ! This was probably the match of his career! Benoit made him look like a BILLION bucks, like he always does for everyone!!! Benoit should have won and brought some prestige back to this dead title! Maybe they didn't let him win because he is Canadian and it was the Great AMERICAN Bash, or maybe the WWE is just retarded! Anyways, Jordan romoves the padding on the turnbuckle and Benoit gets knocked out by it...Jordan doesn't even use a finisher on him or anything! RAW drafted superstar #2 to be screwed, but atleast he got a standing ovation afterwards...7/10 for Benoit, the GREATEST EVER!!!Match #4 The Undertaker vs. Muhammad Hassan #1 contenders match: If the whole UPN crap didn't happen, then we know Hassan would have won! But Taker won and destroyed everything in site after the match!!! The match was decent, but the aftermath was AWESOME! Taker mutilates HASSAN with a vicious last ride through the stage!!! bye bye Hassan! This is where RAW drafted star #3 and #4 get screwed...#3 being Hassan and #4 being Orton! Orton was suppose to interfere here costing Taker the match...but we'll just have to wait till Smackdown! for that...7/10 for the aftermath...Match #5 BwO vs. The Mexicools: Really good for such a short match! Nova suffers a NASTY running drop kick by Super Crazy, OUCH! then Stevie Richards gets his ass kicked all over and pinned...Blue Meanie didn't do ANYTHING here except trot his lard all over the place, HAHA! I'll give both teams credit for humorous entrances with Mexicools on their JUAN Deere's and BwO on their big wheels! 8/10Match #6 Eddie Guererro vs. Rey Mysterio yet again...: Match of the night, but that isn't saying much. Rey's son Dominic was at ringside and Eddie kept looking at him, taunting him, and it even looked like Eddie was gonna snap his neck or something at one point! It was pretty tasteless...but anyways, what happened in the ring was great! Eddie almost had this won yet again after a huge frog splash, but he gave rey just enough time to recover to surprise roll him up for the win! And when this feud finally does end, Rey will still be undefeated against Eddie! Secret to be revealed on Smackdown! cuz Eddie is a LIAR, hahaha! 8/10Match #7 Melina vs. Torrie Wilson w/ Candice Michelle as SGR in a Bra & Panties match: LAME! Technically Melina won, but really EVERYBODY wins here!!! All 3 ladies down to bra & panties, and everybody leaves happy...don't quite get why this was right before the main event though cuz it killed the crowd! 4/10 for the PUPPIES!Match #8 Batista (c) vs. JBL for the World Heavyweight Title: One of the biggest let downs of the night and probably the YEAR! This match was so BORING, probably Batista's worst, but JBL has had worse matches...I don't believe the crap about them blaming this on Batista's in ring work. He sold like a dream for JBL and JBL couldn't do anything to carry this match at all! HE SUCKED! And the DQ finish was CRAP, ABSOLUTE CRAP! HHH couldn't beat Batista in 3 tries yet JBL pulls out the victory here...STUPID! RAW drafted superstar #5 getting screwed here but at least he was granted the pleasure of destroying jBL and Orlando Jordan with the steel chair and Batista Bombs afterwards...JBL vs. Batista 2 at Summerslam and I hope Batista gets a clean win over JBL in his hometown! 6/10 for Batista!!!Don't buy this...it's not even worth adding up the points and giving it a score.

782068,"'Devil's Pond' is a movie that tries to be suspenseful, sometimes shocking, but the final outcome is weak and unconvincing. The story is not original and - most of all - is not gripping and tense.A young middle class woman (Tara Reid) married with a young and handsome guy (Pardue) just to find out in a few days that her husband is a psycho and a really violent one. He imprisioned her in a kind of island in the center of a lake and there start her nightmare and her fight to break free.In fact, that's all the story here. And a story without any background to give any motive at all to the sick personality of the husband. The characters seem to be launched in an absurd situation just to play during ninety minutes a ludicrous and lame game of cat and mouse. Because of that, in a few minutes the viewer became tired with the movie and loses all the interest with the destiny of poor and beautiful Julianne, played by Tara Reid.I think that a good suspense movie needs more than violence, screams and a psycho characther with a mad look on his face to be a really good movie.

23074,"A terrific, outstanding cast couldn't save this one.  Rule #1 in transferring musical to screen--never, EVER tamper with the numbers.  For some reason, the musical was completely retooled for the film, with half of  its best numbers dropped.  If you've never heard or seen the original  musical production, this version has nothing to do with the actual broadway  show.  Consequently, it's way inferior.  What made the musical great was  that it wasn't just about &quot;Annie,&quot; but Christmas and the Great  Depression.  There's nothing about that in here, so the movie loses all the  poignancy of the original.Rule #2--to make a successful show to screen  transfer, the numbers have to be shot in a fantasy style.  Sounds corny,  but I'm telling  you--it works (See the modern version of &quot;Pennies  From Heaven.&quot; As gritty as the storyline is, it works as a musical  precisely because the numbers are shot so unrealistically). When you shoot  a musical in a completely realistic style, no matter how good it is it will  never have the magical feel that makes musicals feel so special; the film  will just look like a regular movie with a bunch of dopes singing out of  context for no reason.  That's exactly what happens here. There's no magic  or charm in this &quot;Annie,&quot; although the cast had enough of it. Oh,  well--what a shame--this could have been better than it was.",Annie

The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the ""desperate"", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship.

23334,"""We're your new neighbors.""""Don't be alarmed, we're negros!""I got that quote from the IMDb entry for ""Bad Boys."" I read some others, and what struck me as funny is that out of all the quotes from the movie that those perusing IMDb have submitted, none have any lines about the plot. All the quotes available are jokes and punchlines that occur in the film between shoot-outs. Nothing else.But I suppose that fits the film just right. It's not a film for those who have any interest in plot, character development, or comedy - things a film such as ""Lethal Weapon"" had. No, ""Bad Boys"" is content with being a bad movie. It's for those with low attention spans. It's for those who like non-stop violence and language. But then, anyone interested in ""Bad Boys"" by now must be warned that the action scenes provide hardly anything new - some shoot-ups, some shoot-outs, some shoot-downs, etc. I am content with recommending action movies (trust me). But sometimes I expect a bit more than just bad jokes and bad action scenes - if it's going to be an action movie, at least make the fight scenes offer something fresh.There's a buddy side to the film that never provides the type of humor that it should. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith play Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey, family man and playboy respectively. They're both undercover in Narcotics division, but yet they find time to stumble upon and into things that have nothing to do with drugs whatsoever. Never mind this.The film opens with an explosive prelude that signals we are in for a Bruckheimer production. It's loud, noisy, and the best part of the film. The rest is all downhill.A stash of drugs has been stolen from a vault in some sort of super-top-secret Government facility thingy somewhere. This happens directly after the opening sequence and goes by pretty quick so that the audience can get back to the action. Marcus and Mike are called onto the scene by their Grouchy Boss (Joe Pantoliano), who likes to spew spit and bite their heads off for everything.Pantoliano's character is the exclamation mark to the rest of the recycled characters and plots. Get this: two mismatched cop/partners who like to throw insults at each other (""Lethal Weapon"") are called onto a case involving a foreign drug dealer (""Red Heat"") who has left behind uncountable traces for the good guys to follow (though it sure does take them a while). Their boss delivers long, shouting speeches at them (""Last Action Hero"" spoofed this finely), and they have to protect a sexy witness (Tea Leoni). Finally they go for a big shoot-'em-up at the end (this is in any action/cop-buddy movie available to the public).""Bad Boys"" is just one long shoot-'em-up flick, with a bunch of recycled action set pieces, recycled plot fragments, and when all that calms down, we are exposed to bad jokes and excessive, ""pervasive strong language"" as the MPAA called it. I enjoyed bits of this movie, I grinned a few times, but I laughed only once - at a joke that should have been more than a laugh. It should have had me bent over in hysterics.Here it is, listen up: Marcus has to pose as Mike every time he is around the witness, Tea Leoni (long story). He takes her to the real Mike's apartment. She wonders why he has pictures of another black man all over the place - and keep in mind she thinks that Marcus is Mike. The pictures happen to be of Mike, since it is his apartment, so Marcus, posing as Mike, tells her it's his partner, and that they're close. The way this scene is delivered is more of a sit-com-type comedy moment - not surprising, since both lead actors got their starts on television sitcoms. But it could have been truly hilarious - it just made me laugh. I also wondered what the real Mike is doing with pictures all over his apartment of himself. And I'm not the only person to wonder this - Roger Ebert asked the same question.I will not discredit Martin Lawrence and Will Smith - the two have chemistry. Unfortunately, they also need a good script that can provide their characters with good interaction and funny moments. There aren't many here. We are supposed to trust their life-long friendship yet they don't display any signs of connection like Gibson and Glover did in the ""Lethal"" movies. Their chemistry alone lifted the last two in the series from being just decent movies.""Bad Boys"" is a movie that has a few funny moments, but none of them are hysterical. We are basically treated to long action sequences that have been done for twenty years, excessive language to guarantee an R-rating and make the movie look tougher, and bad dialogue. The only thing this movie is missing is graphic sexuality - something I heard the new - and supposedly horrible - sequel sports plenty of.Even the biggest of action buffs won't find anything here. I love the cop-buddy genre, but it's getting to be a real bore. Ever since ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""48 Hrs."" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"" came out it's all been retreads of the same old material. Of course, if you like cop-buddy films very much, you may like this film. Especially if you haven't seen very many.",N/A

262989,"The Elizabeth Taylor version of CLEOPATRA has taken quite a beating over the years, and its easy to see why: the film is elephantine, with an emphasis on making everything BIG; as such, it eventually sinks under its own weight.It is difficult to imagine any other actress better suited to play Cleopatra, but Taylor does comparatively little with the role, coming off as less the complex Queen of the Nile than a luxury-loving little minx out for a slinky good time.  Rex Harrison and Richard Burton fare a bit better, although not much. Still, the emphasis is on spectacle--and in spite of the big budgets, historic costuming, and mammoth sets it is really here that the film falls apart.The problem, really, is that the film's spectacle is too imaginative and takes too many liberties.  A good example is found in the role of Cleopatra herself: the historical Cleopatra considered herself Greek and probably wore Egyptian attire only for ceremonial occasions, but the film prefers to present her flatly in stereotypical fashion, when the truth would have been considerably more complex and entertaining.  Much the same may be said for most of the characters in the film.  As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to accept these characters as anything else but movie stars playing parts.And in terms of spectacle, in spite of all the money poured into it, the movie looks cheap.  Sure, they had a budget of heaven only knows how much money, but they had to stretch it to costume so many people that the wardrobe department had to settle for nylon-looking material, and a great many of the sets betray the fact that they are sound-stage created.  Then, when really lavish spectacle occurs--as in Cleopatra's entrance into Rome--the production values clash: they seem to be two completely different movies.It is difficult for me to understand why any one would want to spend money on a VHS, much less a DVD (even with various bells and whistles added), of this particular film.  If you must see the film, you're better off renting it or catching a rerun on cable television.  For CLEOPATRA is essentially a curiosity: a film that should have worked... but didn't.",N/A

390889,"What a totally depressing representation of marriage. I have never read the book and did not know what to expect, but the movie sounded interesting, as I find period pieces enjoyable. The first couple of hours were not terrible and actually drew me in, but then the main characters got married and everything went downhill quick! Marriage, as protrayed in this movie, is a horrible, dreadful thing where the men never stop their side affairs and the wives are forced to find lovers. One man tells his wife, on their wedding day, mind you, he only married her for her money. The other is a homosexual, who we discreetly find out about when the horse groomer gives him a flirty wink, and then we find out in whole, when they are discovered wrapped in each others arms, sleeping in bed (with smiles on their faces). Nan is the unfortunate married to this fellow. But what is quite hard to understand is why Julius (her husband) pursued her so ardently in the first place if his feelings are for men. Second, is why Nan had such fun with Julius before she married him, and then when he wants to sleep with her, she shrieks and crys. What happened to change her feelings? No explanation. She goes completely cold on him after that and seeks out the man she would have married if he hadn't left for a job in a faraway country, but now has returned. The few characters in this movie who seem to think marriage is for life, and that if both husband and wife would put aside selfishness and try to please the other - a good marriage is possible, are made to look loony. Basically this is a movie that shouts if you're not happy, find a way to make it happen.

A LOT of Highlander fans will be quick to tell you that this movie was the worst of the series but after viewing Endgame [check my review for that movie], I'm here to tell you now that this movie is NOT anywhere near as bad as the fans will have you believe. Yes, it's true that this movie goes against everything that the first film's plot established being that the immortals are now aliens from the Planet Zeist [didn't Connor come from Scotland in the first film?????] and for the fact that Ramirez [Sean Connery] is somehow back in this sequel despite being beheaded in the original and yes it's true that the story for this movie really doesn't make any sense at all but i found myself being able to sit through this movie all the way until the end and while it's not as fun as the original Highlander, I find this movie watchable in spite of its numerous horrible ideas. The special effects are pretty cheesy in the original version of this movie [i heard they were updated in the two later re-cuts of this movie but i've never seen either of those yet] and the dialogue is often extremely silly but it does boast a few memorably funny moments [like the scene where Ramirez interrupts a Shakespearean play] and it does feature another memorable villain in General Katana [played well by Michael Ironside who along with Connery steals the show in this movie]. For many Highlander fans, The sole thought about the immortals being from another planet is enough to turn people away from watching this movie but luckily for those turned off by the new plot developments of this sequel, there is always the Renegade version for you to watch [and that and the 2004 special edition are the only versions available on DVD and Blu-Ray since the original version has never been released on either format and probably never will be released on DVD or Blu-Ray due to the general hatred for this version of the film]. I am not saying that this is a great film or even a good film but for what it is, It is a watchable albeit silly action/sci-fi film and it's probably best to just view this movie as a standalone chapter in the Highlander saga.

1111225,"I've been a long time student of the Troubles, and I'm well acquainted with the case of the Birmingham Six, and I think they and the British people owe Chris Mullin a great deal for exposing the wrongful conviction of the Six for the worst case of mass murder on British soil before Lockerbie (which amounts to a huge miscarriage of justice itself given the Scottish Government's indefensible release of one of the bombers after serving just eight years of a supposed minimum of 27 on ""compassionate"" grounds).Unfortunately, I can't recommend ""Who Bombed Birmingham?""  The problem with it is that the story jumps around so much and so quickly (from 1974 to 1985 and back again), the dual narratives (the arrest, torture, and conviction of the Six in 1974 and the journalists uncovering it all in 1985) are never given any time to build momentum or make us care about either the wrongfully convicted men or the campaigning journalists.So the movie was disappointment for me, but I can definitely recommend another movie about a similar miscarriage of justice ""In the Name of the Father.""  It deals with another infamous set of IRA pub bombings and accompanying miscarriages of justice (the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven), has a much higher powered cast, better script, and production values.

798165,"I love Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton..Without too much explanations, they are simply two of the best actors/actresses of all time.But watching Something's Gotta Give, I can not but feel sheer disappointment at the result that could have been far better with a tighter script and better director.First of all the problem with the film is its length, over two hours long..I never minded long films, (I sat through Bertoluccis's Novencetto more times that I can remember without being aware or bothering too much with its length)..But to sit through two hours of an overstretched story that is drenched in sugary sentimentality was tiring.Moreover, the problem with the film is too many unnecessary characters. For instance the characters of Frances McDormand and Paul Michael Glazer, although credited as stars, were too shallow, appearing in a couple of scenes at most and added nothing to the plot.Amanda's Peet character was also very badly written: we see here at first falling for the rich older guy without sleeping with him, inexplicably telling him when they arrived at her mother's house: are you glad we waited?? !!! Then towards the end of the film and in a space of six months,( movie time), we see her the image of domesticity, married and  three months pregnant!!Keanu Reeves also inexplicably falls head over heels with Keaton's character, and their short romance is probably the lamest and most confusing I have seen in a film.Now I have to mention few words about the acting of Nicholson and Keaton:Nancy Meyers manages to get so much over the top acting from them, and fails miserably to get the right performances.The scenes I cringed in the most are the ones we see them crying, probably intended to add some bittersweet humor, but it became overbearingly annoying.When Nicholson cried at the very end of About Schmidt, I connected totally with him, and it was genuinely bittersweet because his tears reflected his whole story, his loneliness, frustration and tinge of hope for the future, in short they had deep meaning. In Something's Gotta Give, even for a comedy, it was totally pointless.Yet I must say that there were few laughs in the first half of the movie, and some promise of a sweet romantic movie, unfortunately lost in the second half, ruining the whole film.Having said all that, the only aspect of the film which I liked, was how refreshing to see people above sixty, falling in love and having sex..not many films have shown that.I now must mention, maybe two trivial observations,that did not help this negative review.The first is the issue of smoking..We see Keaton as an anti smoking healthy woman, but at the end she lights up!! Probably intended to reflect how she has lightened up..but it was a very wrong message to give (and this is coming from a smoker!!) it is time filmmakers take some responsibility in this very sensitive issue.The other observation revolves around a scene when just before making love, Nicholson asks Keaton about birth control pills, and she naturally answers,no menopause!! Although it is kind of a funny dialog, she should have asked him instead whether he had a condom or not!! him being as it has been over emphasized,a sexually promiscuous man..again this would have been a good message to send at a time when sexual transmitted diseases and especially AIDS are still very much with us, and more so with straight people..So Something's Gotta Give is a missed opportunity to take advantage of the wealth of talent involved, and a proof that excellent actors are not enough to make a good movie.",N/A

143256,"This is one of those movies that gore fanatics and Fangoria readers rave about. For them, this movie delivers. For others this is just a rehash of the original with plenty of gore injected to make up for what is lacking in the script. I did get the impression that Hooper may have tired of being nagged to do a sequel to his classic and instead did an over-the-top send-up to put an end to it. Unfortunately this just gave fuel to the idea of a sequel for others to do one. In this sequel the family, now named the Sawyers, has relocated to another texas community. Sally and Franklin's uncle, a Texas Ranger, played by Dennis Hopper, is on the trail of the family. He enlists the aid of a lady DJ nicknamed Stretch (yes, have as much fun with that one as you would like) to draw out the family through her radio broadcasts. Leatherface, now called Bubba (why), takes a liking to Stretch and really wants to show her his chainsaw (I am not kidding, the chainsaw becomes an overly obvious phallic image in this movie). Leatherface also likes to dance when he attacks with his chainsaw by using a move he learned by watching a few too many ZZ Top videos. Beyond this point the movie consists of a lot of gore and redone scenes from the first movie (hit her grandpa, hit her; and even the chainsaw dance at the end). The technical inaccuracies with regard to special effects and continuity with the first film are abundant (anybody familiar with the first film will laugh at the sight of Franklin's flashlight, and let's not even talk about pickups doing 100mph in reverse). If Hoopers intention was parody, he partly succeeded, but with such extreme gore in contrast to the original. The first movie succeeded so well by leaving the gore to the imagination of the viewer; this movie puts all the gore on-screen and suffers for it.-Bob",N/A

1130647,"This one starts out fairly well and cruises along pleasantly right up until Dan's family is introduced.  I'll give it two stars only because there are a few funny moments here and there, but they only serve as false hope.  Steve Carell is great and catches your interest right off the bat, but, the film SERIOUSLY derails during the shower scene in my opinion.  Everything followed a fairly realistic and somewhat humorous approach until Dan's love interest hops in the shower.  It was like a train hitting a wall at that point.At the immediate point she jumps in the shower, I remember thinking, this is going to start sucking now.  And...oh....it does.  It's like two different directors worked on this.  The one who took over after the shower seems like an intern perhaps.  You are then treated to a never ending barrage of ""family"" group activites which are so over-the-top corny that you will surely cringe.  All I can say is there is far too much singing involved.  If you're on my wave length at all, that's all I need to say.Carrell gets the two stars, but the rest of the cast is unremarkable and slightly annoying.

512478,"&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; was this summer's biggest disappointment. It performed well below the expectations at the box-office, and rightly so. &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is filled with uninspired and obvious gags, even  worse, it is not at all funny. This is all the more astonishing since it  stars Will Smith, Kevin Kline and the beautiful Salma Hayek. All of them  proofed to be capable comic actors in previous pictures. Director Barry  Sonnenfeld was also known as a man with a freaky sense of humor (&quot;Men  in Black&quot; and &quot;Adams Family&quot; weren't great films, but at  least succeeded in entertaining the audience).Unfortunately, they don't  score big this time. The special effects are good, but the whole films  appears overproduced and the actors seem to wear signs around the necks  which say what is funny about them.&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is an  example for soulless, uninspired fimmaking (as was &quot;ID4&quot;,  &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Armageddon&quot;).

1167987,"I hate remakes, KAIRO (Pulse) was a Japanese horror film that is quite iconic despite its slow-moving screenplay but it managed to generate a calculated, darkly sinister meditation on life and death with a disturbing denunciation with technology as a destroyer of living humanity. Kiyoshi Kurosawa's defining horror epic revolves around the approach to mortality as seemingly random build ups of related and unrelated events; brought about by a website that brings contact to the supernatural world. 2006's U.S. remake ""Pulse"" misunderstood Kurosawa's main premise and thereby resulted in a film full of creative misunderstanding. In Kairo the science was only secondary, it was more about mortality. ""Pulse"" shouldn't have been an unlimited ""night and weekend"" visual feast of cell phones and computers. This happens a lot of times when American filmmakers attempt to remake an Asian horror film.Sure, PULSE 2: Afterlife isn't a remake of an Asian horror feature. It only expands on the idea of the U.S. remake of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's KAIRO. Directed and written by Joel Soisson (Mimic 2), the sequel isn't really a major visual spookfest, it does attempt to pull something perceivably new out of the bag; the problem is, it suffers from plot inconsistencies and horror movie clich&eacute;s.The world had been reshaped due to the emergence of ghost via the internet. Cities have been deserted, and the few survivors have relocated in small camps, in areas believed to be `dead zones'. Survivors leave behind electrical devices in their relocated areas. Ghosts now wander the Earth in the form of electrical impulses; they continue to haunt their homes and some are unaware that they are dead. Stephen (Jamie Bamber) must now find a way to save his daughter Jusitne from her dead mother Michelle.All right, at first I thought I was about to watch a George Romero feature with ghosts in place rather than zombies. Truth be told, such a film would have been more interesting. I'm not really sure why they felt that a sequel would be necessary (then again, I don't know why they keep on remaking Asian Horror films). The film picks up from the supposed remnants of the first movie. People do know that something had gone terribly wrong and they try to survive.Director Joel Soisson does try to make some sense on the myth that is ""Kairo"". I have to credit the man for trying to explore the myths of the spirit world. This time, he focuses on a father and child being haunted by a dead mother. The film does somewhat feel like a ""custody battle"" being fought between the material and the spirit world. While he tries, he falls to the same clich&eacute;s in horror films, I can't really blame him, he had so little to work with and as I've said, even the first film greatly misunderstood Kurosawa's iconic horror film.The film is actually a chase film of a sort. Stephen isn't really the perfect dad, he had an affair that somewhat justifies his ex-wife's anger. Michelle the dead mother is a little underdeveloped and I found it quite difficult to connect with her. Also, the timetable lacks credibility, or at least not really fully explored. The film does try to throw some ideas in an attempt to add some depth to its simple plot. A guy going around looking like a ""Red Riding Hood"" reject is presented but that subplot goes nowhere. (Maybe there's a Pulse 3?) The small town where Stephen and his daughter fled from is also severely underdeveloped. What happened after they left? Enter the nudity.To its credit, the film does have a few spooky images. The idea of the dead not knowing they're dead is an idea with potential. While its visuals aren't really original and looks like a rip-offs from ""The Ring"" or from a Pang Bros. horror film, the film does manage to generate some scares, however cheap they may be. The scenes of suicide presented potential, but then again, that idea can only go so far. The problem with Pulse 2 is that it suffered from inconsistencies in plot. I thought ghosts can only find you when you have a cell phone or a computer, as reinforced by its first half then we Michelle able to follow Justine (Karla Scott Collins). By the brain's electrical activity perhaps? Maybe, but this possibility has no credible explanation. The film just goes into one dead end after another. The film's climax doesn't offer much either, except for the horror that is a possibility for ""Pulse 3"".PULSE 2: AFTERLIFE isn't the worst horror film you'll find out there but you can definitely find something better quite easily. The issues with the film is that it tried too hard to capitalize on the first film's backdrop that it felt a little rushed and perfunctory. The script felt as if it had been rewritten numerous times. It failed to present a single memorable scene and the film just feels forgettable. It felt too textbook for my tastes and followed the same old flaws in a sequel. American filmmakers missed the point of Kurosawa's KAIRO, thinking that it was just another J-horror flick about a journey into the spirit world. I am not arrogant to say that all of them missed the idea but they definitely messed up its reinterpretation. This sequel just further reinforces that viewpoint.RENTAL [2 - Stars]",N/A
1335198,"Despite an interesting opening half hour, the Brit horror-thriller ""Salvage"" is completely undermined both by its budgetary constraints and by a second half that teeters over into the absurdly laughable.Starting out as kind of a low budget ""28 Days Later"" mixed with ""The Crazies,"" the movie sets up a compelling scenario in which a bland neighborhood is suddnely taken over by gun wielding soldiers who force everyone to stay locked up in their homes while something mysterious and sinister seems to be occurring outside.  Are the soldiers the good guys or the bad guys?  For awhile we're not quite sure, and this chaotic situation manages to generate some effective tension.The main focus of the storyline falls on the character of a mother who gets separated from her estranged daugther and is willing to risk her life by venturing outdoors in order to find her. For the first 30 minutes or so we share in the character's intense confusion as she desperately tries to make some sense of the craziness that's happening around her.  But as the plot becomes bogged down in its claustrophobic indoor setting and a slew of talky revelations between the mother and her rather unappealing ""one night stand,"" the production's lack of a budget becomes more and more pronounced.Where the film really falls apart though is in its second half, which almost looks like it was made by a completely different director. The creepy slowburn of the opening is suddenly replaced by hectic and unconvincing action scenes, ridiculous plot twists and a storyline that suddenly turns into an 80's style creature feature complete with a dopey looking creature/mutant running amok.You sense that the filmmakers thought they were being clever by subverting viewer expectations with a big ""reveal"" that explains the military's presence in the neighborhood and the bloody carnage, but in this case they may have outsmarted themselves by forcing the storyline toward an all-too-predictable conclusion. Had the film stayed the course of its promising opening and been a modest but more intimate ""28 Days Later""-style thriller, it might have been a real sleeper.

I'm saying that this is one movie where the current director should have been kept on for the visuals, and someone else hired to do everything else, because Tarsem Singh HAS NO IDEA HOW TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN VISUALS! the fact that there are a few interesting character scenes are a fluke. watch this movie once for the visual effects, and then forget about it and see movies with some real meaning.",N/A

How original is that?To mix things up a bit, in a transparent effort to make up something ""original"" about the story, Juno decides one day to have sex with her boyfriend. Keep in mind that the most endearing quality about the boyfriend is that he is a totally passive pushover and is easily manipulated by Juno. It is Juno's idea to have sex, and when Juno says she wants sex, the boyfriend, Bleeker, has little say in the matter. Appropriately enough, the seminal act, as it were, is concluded not by smoking cigarettes, but by eating Tic Tacs (one of the many quirks of the film). Of course it was unprotected sex, because as I said, Juno makes up her own rules.Juno gets pregnant and she decides to give the baby to a set of parents of her own personal choosing. Juno's father helps her with the interviews, apparently accustomed to letting his daughter have her way. Juno quickly finds the perfect couple, and she can't wait to dump the unwanted baby on them, almost as if she has found a family to take a pet dog she's had for a month and now has grown bored with. Throughout the pregnancy, Juno continues to be the rude, rule-breaking person she's always been, though here and there we see glimpses of her softer side. She mostly ignores her boyfriend, who never really was a boyfriend anyway.The rest of the story is quite boring, the end is quite silly. But the movie is too earnest to be a comedy, though I have no idea what it is being earnest about. I don't think it's necessary to say more, except that, in the end, after the baby has been given away, Juno inexplicably decides that she, at 16, is suddenly in love with Bleeker, and no one is more surprised than Bleeker himself. It seems that even though Juno prefers to make up her own rules and break everyone else's, there is, after all, one rule that she would like to believe in: the rule of happily ever after. And if that doesn't make sense after what I've described before, it's not supposed to. :-)For those of you looking for a good, earnest, quirky movie about first love, I would suggest The Sterile Cuckoo with Liza Minnelli. It's an old movie (1969) and may be hard to find. The novel by John Nichols is good, too.",Juno
1069858,"When I saw this movie first listed, I thought that some one had misspelled ""Transformers"" for the title. But, it turned-out to be a separate film entirely. Being curious, I decided to invest the 86 minutes of my night off to watch it.The movie begins by stating that humans had discovered life on a planet 200 million light years away and had sent a message of friendship. The aliens responded by sending an invasion force to Earth which killed-off 90% of humans in a short span of time. The remaining humans fled underground to live and the aliens left the humans alone, as long as humans didn't interfere with them. After hundreds of years, the humans finally embark on an effort to reconquer Earth from the aliens. After the initial attempt fails, a maverick human is enlisted for the second attempt. This human, Warren Mitchell, had been put in cryogenic freeze for an attempted mutiny five years previously, along with some of his followers. Mitchell then reassembles his old team of followers to embark on the new mission. Essentially, this new mission is make-or-break for the human race. If they win, the aliens will be defeated and Earth will be ours again.Now, as far as the storyline goes, there is a lot borrowed from movies and TV series, especially Battlestar Galactica and Terminator, in the ""humans versus robots"" genre. Even Galactica 1980 seems to have inspired a bit in this film, in the form of flying motorcycles. Star Wars fans will also recognize a familiar name in the character named General Veers. I guess the writers decided to take a little inspiration here and a little inspiration there. The human survivors fighting a battle against the android army, which is led by a central tower is a vivid reminder of the Terminators being led by Skynet. Likewise, the entire scenery is dark with a ruined landscape, like the Terminator flashbacks showed in Terminator and Terminator Two. The difference is that the androids don't look like humans and the androids can assume two forms: the mobile biped form and a combat form where they actually transform themselves into a lethal weapon that launches missles. So, the androids can be ""more than meets the eye"", but not much more.Special Effects in this movie were very basic and often look like they were created on somebody's home computer and, at times, reminded me of the graphics in some computer games. The weapons fire looked like something out of an old sci-fi movie from the 1960s. Humans even have fighter planes, although it is never explained how they were created and how the aliens even allowed the humans to develop them, especially the test flights that would have needed to be done for the aircraft. You'd think that an intelligent alien race would have shot those things down when they saw them or destroyed any location where they could have been launched from. So, the aliens can travel 200 million light years in 5 years time and conquer the Earth, but lack basic military tactics, aside from ""find human, kill human"" and launching themselves in wave attacks in mass. Okay, maybe I expect too much in this angle.The quality of acting in this film varies from pretty good to pretty wooden. The characters of Mitchell and Itchy are the best acted, while the others are unconvincing. You don't feel the characters emotions projecting from the screen. All the characters wear black or other dark colors, which blends-in with the overall darkness of the entire planet. There are a few non-Caucasian characters in the film, but most of them are white. But, all the Caucasians are pale and lacking anything like a tan and this is good, since the Sun has been blotted-out for centuries by the aliens and it would be hard to explain a tan in such a place. There are no elderly people or children seen throughout the entire film, with the sole exception of the Chairman. Otherwise, everyone is in their twenties or thirties. All the female characters are hotties, to be sure, while the men range from rugged-looking to average. My favorite character is Itchy, who is Mitchell's buddy and former co-mutineer. I liked him because he seemed to be the most real of all the people in the film.Action scenes, if they can be called that, look like something out of a drama class. You don't feel like a real fight is going-on at any time and there is no sense of anger or desperation projected by the people involved.When I saw this movie, I did watch it all the way through. I will admit that much. If you are a fan of the old Flash Gordon serials, this movie comes pretty close in quality to the SFX and acting from those movies.I was surprised at a little plot twist near the end, which I did not expect and it was only vaguely hinted at earlier in the movie. That twist plays a crucial role for the conclusion of the film and is the only reason I gave Transmorphers more than one star. I never laughed while watching Transmorphers and I was never on the edge of my seat. There are no sad scenes to make you cry. Nothing to make you care about any of the characters or even the whole human race, for that matter.At best, it's a B-grade movie which does seem to borrow heavily from other, successful, films and the effects and acting are below what most of us would pay for to see in a movie, unless you like the low-grade stuff. At $3.99 to rent, I'd advise renting something else that won't make you grit your teeth in frustration at all the things wrong with this film and I sure wouldn't pay $14.99 to actually own it.",Transmorphers

535672,"Most positive reviews for this movie seem to be centered around one fraze: ""Gerard Butler is HOT!"". Well, so he is. He manages to be funny at times, as well. But these qualities a watchable horror movie do not make. Butler's Dracula is the kind of a vamp you would invite to a dinner party to liven up the conversation and keep your single friends happy; you'd just want to wear a chastity belt around your neck at all times...He makes being a vampire an interesting proposition: you keep your youth, have lots of worry free sex, and in an instant gain formidable martial arts skills (the newly minted undead show off the kind of aerial highjinx that would make Bruce Lee green with envy...). So, why exactly is the guy so tormented???Further adding to the annoyance is the supporting cast full of TV actors. It is difficult to envision that harmless stoner from That Seventies Show, or that brilliant doc from House, as vicious vamps...Add an endless parade of cliches (long cape for Dracula seems to be a fashion staple) and smoke machines in overdrive, and your taste for blood... of the filmakers... enters a critical stage.The true star of the film is the brilliant idea for the origins of Dracula. No, I will not give away the secret, for, if you do decide to watch the film, this will be your only reward for doing so... Unfortunately, the makers waste here a fantastic opportunity to make a substantial contribution to the Dracula saga. To put it plainly, they have produced a poorly crafted movie.

1128260,"I felt obligated to write a good review about this play since I am very much a Tyler Perry fan but I truly just did not like this play. If it was really about health disparities, I think he should have emphasized it more. I mean, he made me happy by putting Christian Keyes, Ryan Gentles and svelte Terrell Carter in the play but other than them and of course, David and Tamela Mann, everything else fell short. I think I mostly did not like D'Atra Hicks' performance because it was just too much. What man who got a medical degree from Yale would be interested in a woman so CRAZY! And she was so demure in Family Reunion that I was shocked this was the same woman. Her character was just tooo crazy. The plot seemed rushed and points were not focused upon long enough to make them stick.Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVED ""Why did I get Married,"" the movie. It is probably Tyler's best work but when he brings movies out too quickly after the other, he falters. For instance, compare Family Reunion and Daddy's Little Girls. Also, Why Did I Get Married and Meet the Browns (he really should not have cast Rick Fox in that movie at all--terrible move). I hope he realizes this; when his movies come out too quickly after another, one pales in comparison and quality suffers.

395392,"For me, the part where Rocky II failed were the Adrian scenes. I loved the new developments in Adrian and Rocky's relationship, through the not-so-romantic proposal (my heart still melted though) to their son being born (more about him later.)I won't ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, but there's a whole chunk of the movie where Adrian doesn't do anything. Therefore, Rocky doesn't do anything. The whole sequence was overly long, and could have been cut down a bit.Rocky II follows straight on from the first one. With an overly long flashback to the end fight of the last one. Which may work if you haven't seen the first one in a while, and be needing of a gentle reminder, but I saw these a week apart!There's nothing different between this an the original, Rocky & Apollo Creed are fighting again, we've met all the characters already, and Adrian & Rocky's relationship develops quickly. Adrian gives birth to a gorgeous baby boy, with a head of black hair, which instantly made my womb (that is on the list!) skip a beat. He is so gorgeous! It's pretty much an uplifting story, with Rocky going through a character arc, and struggling with what happens in the weeks/months after the fight. He goes on a small shopping spree, fast cars, nice coat for the wife, nice coat for himself and a luxury apartment that they can't really afford. But the money doesn't last long - not with the rate he spent it - and he finds himself running broke, and itching to fight again.So far, I've seen Rocky I, II, III, IV (the latter of which I nearly forgot about!) and Rocky Balboa. This is definitely the weakest in my opinion. But mainly because of the scenes with Adrian. Otherwise it's good fun.",N/A

Giamatti is pretty funny and there are some other humorous moments in the film, but they are the only positives about this film, and the only thing that save it from getting a 1 star rating from myself.  The story itself is just silly, I really can't think of a better word to describe it.  The most ridiculous plot hole, and one of the worst plot holes I've ever seen, is the fact that every character that comes along and is told about this crazy story unfolding at their apartment complex just believes it, don't question it in anyway, and just go along with this silly fairytale as if they live in lala land and it's all perfectly normal.

724801,"Whether this 1997 ABC television movie version was entirely faithful to Stephen King's original novel is almost irrelevant.  The film is doomed from the start for two reasons; the minor being that when you have the now-classic 1980 Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson version (faithful or not!) looming in the shadows like a parasite, you can't possibly expect to come close.  The major reason being, simply put, it wasn't scary; not even a little bit.If you're making a Stephen King TV movie out of a Stephen King book that's supposed to be scary, and it ISN'T, then it's project over!  Not that it can't be done on TV, though.  IT and THE STAND were effectively frightening in all the right places.

321593,"A Midnight Clear (Keith Gordon, 2002)Keith Gordon will probably be best remembered for playing Arnie Cunningham in John Carpenter's so-so film version of Stephen King's so-so novel Christine. Gordon, however, hung up the acting togs in the late eighties and went behind the camera, and it is here he has truly shined, turning out such brilliant movies as Waking the Dead and television genius on such series as House, Dexter, and Homicide: Life on the Street. The man has an amazing track record. So it's with some confusion that I regard those works where Gordon comes off as being somewhat less accomplished. A Midnight Clear is one of them.Based on a novel by William Wharton, A Midnight Clear is the story of a World War II platoon (full of misfits, natch) who are ordered to scout out a mansion inside enemy territory. They encounter the enemy-- but not an enemy they expect. The survivors of a German platoon are in a house down the hill looking to surrender. The two groups spend a companionable Christmas together before they turn to the task of deciding how to get each other out of the situation they've found themselves in-- enemies in wartime becoming friends.This is not your typical war film; characterization is much more important than action here, and as in many other substandard war films of this stripe (Hart's War and Tigerland immediately come to mind), it almost seems as if the director wanted to still play it as an action film. There's not enough real character development here to float the entire movie; we get to know our main character well enough, and the character upon whom the entire plot will turn later. We get a little less on the guy who's here for the purpose of building sympathy. On the rest of the platoon, very little, and on the enemy, nothing. We know more about the back-line lieutenant-- a minor character at best-- than we do about the Germans.Not up to the standards set by either Gordon or Wharton. **",A Midnight Clear VHS

It is painfully clear that the writers are riding the wave of publicity this show gets and letting it sail off into syndication.What originally attracted me to this show is gone.

It satred out with some nuce fast paced action and than slowed down a little. London got the hot tag and cleaned house. LOts of near falls. Good job by the wwe to give these guys 15 minutes of good action it payed off big time. Winners and new wwe tag team champs london and kendrick. Match Rating 8/10.2. Chris Beniot vs. Finlay- This was a decent match. I really thought that it dragged on a little to long and took up about 20 minutes. Thes guys still put alot intoi this match and they really did a good job the last 5 minutes and both men pulled there won here. Not alot to say a decent match. Winner chris beniot. Match Rating 7/10.3. Jillian vs. Milian- This was a really good womens match for smackdown but that is not saying much.

Super Crazy vs. Ghergory helms for the cruiserwieght title- This was a below average cruiserwieght match and it kind of let me down a little. The bad parts about the match was there were to many slpper holds in this match which should never happen in a cruiserwieght match. The crowd was out of it but this is still passable but below standereds for a cruiserwieght match. Winner and still wwe crusierwieght champ. Gregory Helms. Match Rating 6/10.5. Mark Henry vs. Kurt Angle- This was a better match than the rumble. I thought it was going to be just as bad if not worse. It started off with good intensity but slowed down a little. Lots of near falls and angle showed that even he can carrie mark henry in a match. Some good aftermath helped this match and some sick chair shots to henry helped this and a nice table spot as well. Winner mark henry by countout. Match Rating 6.5/10.6. Bobby Lashey vs. Booker T in the king of the ring final- This was was a good match for the time that the wwe gave it. I thought that 9 minutes was way to short. Anyway still a good match with non stop action all the way through. Lashey kicked out of a siccors kick and a book end which created alot of near falls. Lokked like he was going to put him awayt but finlay screws him. Good match. Winner Booker T. Matc Rating 7.5/10.7. The Great Kahli vs. The Undertaker- This was not a good match at all. What i expected was a big man match and that is what they gave us. Kahli dominated the whole match and made taker look like a fool thats how bad it was. Taker should have won here and kahli wont last lonmg in the wwe. They kept it kind of short which was a good thing and all you see here is ounces and irsh wips. Winner the great kahli. match rating 3/10.8. Jbl vs. Rey Mysterio for the Wht- this was a good way to close off the show. This told a decent storyline and was well played out. Crowed was really behind rey here and jbl mocked eddie guerrero which earned him more heat. Jbl controlled alot of this match and at one point rey was busted open bad. Soild wrestling and rey kept battling from behind. Lots of near falls and the ending surprised me which is always good. Winner and still whc rey mysterio.

281620,"&lt;strong>Night of the Living Dead&lt;/strong> (Tom Savini, 1990)Another of those ""I swear I reviewed this back when it came out, but can find no record whatsoever of that review"" reviews. Twenty years later, therefore, I'm reviewing it again. Film culture has changed almost entirely in those twenty years; the idea of remaking a classic horror film is now as common in Hollywood as is making a rom-com, and having someone who worked on the original direct is not out of the question. In 1990, though, that was groundbreaking stuff, and we were all slavering at the bit to see what Tom Savini, who got his start as the make-up guy on the original 1968 production of &lt;em>Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em>, would do with Romero's updated (without the assistance of longtime confederate John Russo, who wrote the original novel upon which the first script, by Russo and Romero, was based)  screenplay and a somewhat better-known cast who, unlike the cast of the original, were obviously destined for bigger and better things rather than being friends of the crew (or, in many cases, the crew themselves).I won't say it's totally botched. I would have in 1990. In fact, I'm pretty sure I &lt;em>did&lt;/em> in 1990. Remaking &lt;em>Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em> and making Barbara a strong, intelligent female lead may have made for good press, and in fact the character of Barbara is written quite well (and brought to life exceptionally by Patricia Tallman, who would go on to fame and fortune in the TV series &lt;em>Babylon 5&lt;/em> soon after). But what you get is... not &lt;em>Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em>. It's something else entirely when the major part of Ben's burden--looking after a dazed Barbara who is deeply in shock, and was never all that well put-together to begin with--is taken off his shoulders. He has more time to make good decisions, rather than the stressed-out-but-viable ones he makes in the original film. Only that doesn't happen here, and that makes the entire film even less plausible. Well, okay, talking about ""less plausible"" when dealing with a zombie movie is probably stretching it a bit, but come on. Look at the final montage in the original movie, with the rednecks driving around popping zombies. The situation is clearly under control. How did civilization get to the point of the beginning of &lt;em>Dawn of the Dead&lt;/em>? That question has been nagging at zombie fans for almost half a century, and if anything, the remake makes it even &lt;em>less&lt;/em> plausible that we could get from point A to point B, given that even rednecks could keep this thing under control. But I digress.In case you've been living in a cave since 1968, here's the plot: Barbara (Tallman) and Johnny (&lt;em>House of 1000 Corpses&lt;/em>' Bill Moseley) are in suburban Pittsburgh to put flowers on their mother's grave after church when Johnny is accosted and killed by what seems to be a demented mourner (make-up artist Greg Funk in one of his few on-camera roles). Barbara flees to a nearby farmhouse, where she finds Ben (Tony Todd, who would become an A-list horror actor two years later in &lt;em>Candyman&lt;/em>) already holed up. The crazed folks outside, of course, turn out to be the living dead, hungering for the flesh of the living, and Barbara and Ben, plus a cast of others who turn up later in the film, have to figure out how to either shore up their defenses to stop the zombies from getting in or escape to someplace more defensible.I've only touched on the cast here. Tom Towles (&lt;em>Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer&lt;/em>), William Butler (&lt;em>My Dog Skip&lt;/em>), Katie Finneran (&lt;em>You've Got Mail&lt;/em>) in her acting debut, Heather Mazur (from the short-lived TV adaptation of &lt;em>Crash&lt;/em>) in HER acting debut, and TV character actress McKee Anderson (&lt;em>Angel on My Shoulder&lt;/em>) round out the principals here. This is not a low-budget-horror-film cast. Savini, on the other hand, gets lost in the same mire a number of other successful small-screen directors get lost in: directing for the big screen is a different beast entirely. (To date, Savini has not attempted to direct another feature-length film.) Specifically, here, the pace gets muddled a lot towards the middle.None of that, however, changes the movie's major failing: taking Barbara's character through a one-eighty without any thought as to what sort of fallout that would entail among the character dynamics or the greater interaction with the world in general. And, as a result, it stands as an interesting, if failed, attempt to kind of requantify the canon. It's worth watching once for comparison purposes, but for the most part, just stick with the original and you'll be fine. **",N/A

Sadly I was disappointed...While the plot seems pretty straight forward, they kind of try to make unnecessary characters tie into the movie (i.e. The rock... troll.. things?). I also felt the &#34;evil&#34; character in this movie was unnecessary and probably would've been better without this character.Also some of the character introductions (aside from the main girls [Elsa and Anna]) just didn't really tie into the plot, I mean Kristoff is an ice harvester, but they could've just introduced him the first time in the movie to Anna instead of giving him an unnecessary back story aside from what he tells her the first time they meet.Last but not least, the songs.. The songs in this movie are SO BORING, and I mean that in the most honest way possible. As a man who LOVES musicals, these songs were just kind of lackluster for a Disney movie, or any musical feature in general, even &#34;Let It Go&#34; was just kinda boring.The reason I don't hate this movie entirely (personally I give it a 2.5 star rating) was because of Olaf (The Snowman) and Sven (The Reindeer), as well as some of the grown up themes within the movie. Other than that, everything was pretty lackluster and I couldn't really connect with any of the main characters.",N/A
946604,"""The Great Raid"" is a film so standard in concept and so lifeless in execution that it can be frustrating at times to watch. It is a bad movie not because it has tried to achieve something and has failed, but because it has tried to achieve so very little in the first place. Stock characters, hackneyed dialogue, and poor direction are not the ingredients of a good war film. War films need not be completely original and inventive to be worth watching, but if of a formulaic approach, they need to at least be exciting and well made to be successful. ""The Great Raid"" succeeds in very little other than boring its viewers. It is a typical war film of the worst kind, with no passion in its storytelling and with an execution so dull it may as well have been titled ""War Film #483.""The film is about a daring raid to free American POWs in Japanese controlled territory in the South Pacific during World War II. The battle is turning heavily in the favour of the Americans, but the fleeing enemy forces have taken to executing their remaining POWs, and a group of highly trained Americans are sent in to rescue a camp of 500. The opening to the film is very effective, with war footage and narration used to establish the story and set a historic and tense tone to the film. The first scenes of Japanese cruelty to American prisoners are also good and are perhaps the most emotionally effective scenes of the film. From there, however, it becomes clear that the film will be nothing more than one long lead up to the `great raid.' This could be effective, but the attempts to create sympathy for the characters that will fight and fall in the raid are so heavy-handed and clich&eacute;d that all effect is lost. As a result of this poor character development, by the time the rather anti-climactic finale occurs it seems of little concern who lives and who dies.One of the main problems with the film is the acting. It is poor at best. James Franco and Benjamin Bratt are ripe examples of why most television actors should stick to television. Their performances are so dull and their dialogue so forced, I could not have cared less about the characters they portray. Actors, I feel, should be able to convincingly deliver more than one emotion, a level of talent these two actors fail to achieve. The only notable actor in the film, Joseph Fiennes, is given a character so ill throughout the entire film that his performance ends up about as sickly as the others. The poorly written, clich&eacute; ridden screenplay is of no help, but these actors fail to do anything remotely interesting or watchable with the characters they are given.The story may be a great one, but this dull film fails to do it justice. The film is not without some worthwhile cinematography and an occasional watchable scene, but by the time the predictable loose-end-tying text comes up at the end of the film, I could not help but be thankful.",N/A

1143201,"I'm not going to spend a lot of time discussing this film, because quite frankly it isn't worthy of that much attention.  But since it is a British period piece based on a prestigious novel, a lot of people went nuts over it.  Essentially the plot deals with a young girl, who driven by jealousy, tells a lie that ends up ruining the lives of two people.  The title, as you have probably gathered, refers to her attempts to atone for this one mistake.  There are lots of things wrong with this movie.  For starters, the acting isn't up to the material.  James McAvoy and Keira Knightley fizzle in the lead roles.  The central plot device, i.e. the lie that destroys their lives, is rather unplausible.  It seems to me that any kind of real detective work would have revealed the truth.  But the biggest problem is that the movie is emotionally empty.  Shouldn't a film that deals with a character's guilt and remorse sting with the ache of regret and sorrow?  You never feel anything for any of these characters.  It's only in the final moments, when Vanessa Redgrave shows up that the film generates any real emotion.  By that time, you stopped caring about any of what was going on a long time ago.",N/A

1264047,"Take a story about the failing newspaper industry and the government's use of private security firms here and abroad (forgetting to include any big moments of action or intense drama), and add in a cast of great stars and character actors doing mediocre performances, and you get ""State of Play"". I enjoy thrillers and based on the cast, I expected a lot more in this movie. There were a couple of plot twists that kept it from being completely predictable and perhaps one or two thrilling scenes, but that was it. This is a movie which doesn't succeed in saying much and doesn't make you feel much at all. I never saw the BBC series it was based on, so I cannot make comparisons. There were times it felt like the movie itself was a TV show of only so-so quality; the original might've been much better.Russell Crowe plays Cal McAffrey, an old school reporter working at the Washington Globe, a newspaper recently bought by a new media conglomerate and fighting to stay afloat. Rachel McAdams is Della Frye, the upstart blogger working at the paper who begins with very different ideas on reporting. A story starts to unfold where Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is at the center of a standard political scandal. He's on a panel investigating PointCorp, a private firm hired by the government for security overseas and at home, when Sonia, a researcher on the case whom he was having an affair with, is killed. McAffrey forms a theory about a conspiracy and partners with Frye to investigate. To complicate matters, Collins is an old friend of McAffrey, and in the past McAffrey had an affair with Collins's wife.Thus the standard plot of an evil security firm doing anything to make money is laid out, along with a politician having an affair. Several times the movie demonstrates how newspapers are being pushed aside in favor of online news; however, it never seems to make a strong case for print media. The only case made is that reporters regardless of their media need to follow leads and be diligent in researching. I couldn't help but think when they were submitting a story to be printed that many people probably would've already read the news online by then or seen it on TV.Part of my problem with the movie is that it never made me care strongly about any of the characters. Crowe is a wonderful actor but he showed little emotion here. Helen Mirren demonstrated more emotion as the newspaper editor, but the only emotion seemed to be anger. Despite what his character was going through, Affleck didn't seem to show much emotion outside of one scene.The movie started with a cookie cutter plot and aside from a couple of plot twists did little to grab my attention. There was nothing special about the action sequences (few that there were) or the cinematography. And whether it was the acting, the script, or the directing, none of the characters really stood out or elicited much emotion.",N/A

661537,"Let me begin by saying I absolutely love South Pacific. It was the very first musical I ever saw (my parents took me to the movie when it came out, when I was hardly more than an infant) and I grew up listening to the Broadway sound track.I'm a big fan of Harry Connick Jr.'s musical work, and I think he's an excellent actor. I've been impressed by Glen Close's work, I think Robery Pastorelli is a pretty decent comic actor, and when I saw the ""Making of South Pacific"" promo on TV, I made a point of setting my VCR to catch the movie. I was ready to really enjoy this show.And boy, was I let down. First of all, no matter how good she looks, Glen Close does not look like a young nurse. She doesn't even look like a middle aged nurse. In her scenes with Rade Sherbedgia, despite all the soft focus photography (and half of this movie looked like it was shot through a pound of vaseline) she didn't look anything like a young woman swept off her feet by an older man. To tell the truth, she looked like Sherbedgia's mother. When Nellie sings that she's just a simple girl and Emil is a sophisticated man, it borders on the tragicomic.But what makes or breaks a great musical is the singing. Both the Broadway and the original Hollywood versions of this movie were characterized by great voices. The part of Emile de Becque was played on Broadway by Ezio Pinza, and on the screen sung by Giorgio Tozzi, both strong and expressive baritones with an operatic background. The ingenue leads were the great Mary Martin and Mitzi Gaynor. Even the smaller parts were played by dynamic performers like Broadway's Juanita Hall, whose ""Bali Hai"" sends chills down your back.But these TV version is completely lacking in anything approaching a dynamic vocal performance. Connick, an excellent singer in his own genre, does a workmanlike job with ""Younger Than Springtime"" and then delivers a half-spoken, half sung and essentially emotionless version of ""You've Got To Be Taught"". Sherbedgia, who has some of the strongest songs in the show, can barely produce a whisper. When Pinza sang ""This Once Was Mine"" it brought tears to your eyes; when Sherbedgia sings it, it's incidental music. It's almost as if the entire cast were picked so as not to show up the limited vocal abilities of the star.All in all a tremendous disappointment. Even if you liked the TV version- especially if you liked it- you owe it to yourself to buy the Broadway album and hear this music as it was meant to be heard.",Rodgers & Hammerstein's South Pacific VHS
1632154,"Those expecting a slick Ridley Scott tale where the hero gets over or gets away will lose their lunch and then have their heads handed to them.  The moral of the story, if you could call it that, is that you can't dabble in crime, and you can't dally with evil.  Either you have to be prepared to go all the way, and lose everything in the process, or the sharks will gobble you up like the pathetic little minnow you are.  Brad Pitt tries to warn Michael Fassbender of this just before Fassbender makes one bad decision that derails his entire life.  The cast is superb and several of the set pieces are flawlessly executed, but when the cast begins to suffer the same fate (flawlessly executed), I felt caught in the same inexorable trap.  Honestly, I watched this film several weeks ago, and it has cast a pall on my existence ever since.  Hopefully writing this review will serve as some sort of much-needed therapy.This grim and gory cautionary tale is to me what Pitt tried to be to Fassbender:  I consider myself properly motivated to stay well away from the dark side of human endeavors.",The Counselor

Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, Ray Liotta, Kelsey Grammer, Forest Whitaker, Grant Sullivan, Jay Mohr, and Carla Gugino all play individuals whose only real connection is that they are in some way or another touched by the evils of gambling.Robert Tannen's overstuffed screenplay wanders all over the map, forcing the actors to spend most of their time just trying to keep up with all the narrative permutations (no need to reiterate them here).  The most ludicrous subplot features DeVito as a washed-up magician who contemplates a professional comeback by teaming up with the best-selling author and compulsive gambler played by Basinger.  Individually, any of the various plot strands might have made for an interesting movie, but taken together, they just keep getting in each others' way.Veteran filmmaker Mark Rydell has not only helmed the piece but appears in a crucial cameo role late in the film.

490298,"Featuring early performances by Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix, Explorers is a very basic kid's sci-fi film featuring three middle school boys who are able to build a spaceship out of junkyard parts and then use the one genius' technological ""flying ball"" wonder to cause the ship to be able to travel into outer space, eventually to an extra-terrestrial spaceship featuring 2 goofball green alien monster kids who just happen to have a huge love for American television. If this sounds completely far-fetched, that's because it is. But what you end up with is an overall just barely average film with very little real comedy and very little enticing action. I bought this movie as I am a big fan of 80's films and was looking forward to seeing 2 very classic Hollywood actors in early child roles. Yet what I ended up watching was really, a disappointment.Initially, the ""space team"" really only involves River Phoenix and his friend played by Ethan Hawke, River being the science wiz and Hawke being the more rambunctious lady's man. They eventually recruit the anti-bully anti-hero rough and tough kid (played by an actor I don't remember), and the three set out to build an elaborate flying machine. Unfortunately, what starts out in what could be a very interesting premise given these character's personalities is wasted on a plot that nobody really cares for. River invents some sort of hovering device which he can somehow create using his computer and control it as well. The effects for this pink ball thing are cheesy at best, but then again I'll forgive it as this is an 80's budget film. The three boys then go to a scrap yard and we get our obligatory montage scene of the them using all types of hardware to create a floating metal ball they can all three travel in. All this time you're wondering where the movie is actually going, or if there is any real conflict or antagonist these kids encounter. There isn't. Thus still, we're there watching these three kids we ACTUALLY LIKE going through the motions of a preset barely average plot.The kids eventually get into outer space and land in some kind of ship where they meet up with a very child-friendly green googly-eyed alien who just happens to be just around the three boys' ages. They also meet his googly-eyed kid alien sister. What follows is the second half of this mostly yawn-inducing yarn where we just get to watch this dumb alien spout off pop culture tv references. The three boys are figuring out that these aliens are ""just like them,"" so as not to scare any little kids watching the movie. The alien kids eventually get in trouble with their alien dad and the three boys are back off to their own home planet.The biggest gripe I had with this movie is that it really does nothing, and goes nowhere. There is no real conflict between the boys and another antagonist, or even conflicts within the boys themselves. The film starts off showing these three boys in their middle school setting, which could very well have been used to introduce new characters that maybe the boys could have had some sort of dealings with in regards to their space project. One girl shows up who Ethan Hawke's character likes but nothing is ever made of it. The rebellious boy of the trio saves Hawke's character from getting beat up, but nothing is ever made of the conflict between them and the bullies. Not even any of their parents are ever showcased. In short, nothing is ever done. What is even more aggravating than this is that these boys really do put on great performances, and each of their own characters is highlighted well, thus we come to really like them, and maybe hope they can be used in some other ways. Perhaps Ethan could have ""accidently"" brought on board the girl he likes, or be forced to do so. Perhaps one of their parents could have come into conflict with them and their spaceship building project. Perhaps the bullies could have messed up the boys' plans somehow, or stolen the science nerd's idea about the flying orb, and used it in irresponsible ways, causing the boys to devise some kind of plan. I don't know, SOMETHING besides what we get here. Because anything else would have worked given the three very good and willing actors these filmmakers had to work with. Yet we get nothing, and I wish the entire portion of the scipt having the boys land on the alien spaceship had been scrapped, as that overly long, overly annoying and overly boring part of the film really ruins the entire thing completely.So if you want to put on something that'll entertain your 3 year old (as I don't really see this film entertaining anyone older than that), then buy this one and pop it in for an hour and a half. They'll forget it in 10 minutes, as will you.",Explorers VHS

It is okay to do so in a movie if they work, but they don't in this one. For dramatic effects, the scriptwriter follows an old and tired Hollywood formula: imminent danger of exposure, last minute cancellation of the plan, car chase of the plane on the tarmac, etc. I have seen too many movies with that storyline. As a result, the movie is terribly boring. The true story is much more interesting. If all the fabricated dramas were cut out leaving only the true story behind, the movie would have been a lot more authentic and believable.

713224,"An Italian production, Eaten Alive (Mangiati Vivi) is a mind-numbing fantasy adventure set in the jungles of New Guinea, involving cannibals, and a religious cult, similar to that in Jonestown, Guyana.  This film is not for the squeamish, as true to the title, people are indeed eaten alive.  Also served up are ample nudity, dismemberment, sexual abuse, rape, decapitation, severed genetalia, and the butchery of humans and animals.  Does it sound like a fun time?Sheila Morris (Janet Agren) leaves New York for New Guinea, in search of her older sister Diane (Paola Senatore) who has vanished there.  Upon arrival, she enlists the help of adventurer Mark Butler (Robert Kerman) to act as a guide.  The ill prepared pair head into the jungle, and against long odds, do manage to locate Diana, living at religious sanctuary deep in the wilds, called the `unification village'.  The group is led by the charismatic Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov), who apparently keeps his subjects under control through the use of religion, intimidation, and drugs.  It is a bizarre situation, and Jonas who enjoys abusing women while they are under the influence, soon has Sheila naked and painted gold.  The jungle is infested with cannibals, who make escape from the village nearly impossible.  Butler finds this is true when he attempts an escape, only to be forced to return to the village by the ferocious blood thirsty cannibals.  Enlisting the help of a native woman (Me Me Lai), Butler comes up with a final ill-fated plan for escape.This version of director Umberto Lenzi's film runs just over 92 minutes long (not the 87 minutes stated on the back cover), and features some shocking scenes of brutality, where people are hacked up and consumed raw, in a most casual manner.  Whether realistic or not, there are few things as terrifying as being on the bottom of the food chain.  The cannibals function similar to a traditional monster, and are turned loose for best dramatic effect.  The religious cult element adds even more campy madness to the mix, pushing matters well over the top.  Jonas rules like an emperor, and he and many in his group, appear remarkably well groomed for living in the middle of a forest.

296739,"Night and Day is probably the worst of the reverential ""biographies"" of America's great theater composers which Hollywood cranked out in the Forties. Rodgers & Hart, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Sigmund Romberg, the list goes on, were all smoothed out, glossed over, given awful dialogue and had to see their songs so over-produced at times it must have seemed that they were hearing the heavenly choir.Night and Day gives us a number of Cole Porter songs polished and massaged with the lush sound stage treatment. The movie also gives the songs pretentious orchestrations so foreign to Porter's style, plus bowdlerized and rewritten lyrics to insure little of Porter's naughtiness would survive to possibly offend middle America.Most surrealistically, we have Cary Grant as Cole Porter...and that is the kind of casting that makes the Hollywood studio system so wonderful to read about. In addition to being one of the great theater composers, Porter was short, enthusiastically gay, a bit pop-eyed and a terrible social snob. On the other hand, he was supposed to have had a great sense of humor, and reportedly was highly amused when Cary Grant was chosen to portray him. (Another odd bit of Hollywood casting was choosing Mickey Rooney to play Lorenz Hart in Words and Music.)One or two good biographies have been written about Porter. As a film biography, though, Night and Day is largely a work of hack Hollywood fiction. But don't we at least get a bunch of his songs? Sadly, the songs have been so over-produced, treated so respectfully and have been so sanitized, that watching the numbers often is just downright irritating.Porter, such a social snob and living the kind of high-maintenance life some might consider simply frivolous, is worth knowing because of his songs...and his songs are best enjoyed when they are performed with impudence and style. It's smart to remember that when he wrote...I love youHums the April breeze.I love youEcho the hills.I love youThe golden dawn agreesAs once more she seesDaffodils.It's spring againAnd birds on the wing againStart to sing againThe old melody.I love you,That's the song of songsAnd it all belongsTo you and me....he wrote it to win a bet that he couldn't write a hit love song using mundane images. Porter won the bet and thoroughly enjoyed seeing what he consider a mediocre string of cliches become widely popular.  If you enjoy detective work as well as Cole Porter songs, track down the CD's produced by Ben Bagley, the Cole Porter Revisited series of albums. I think Porter might have enjoyed them. And there is also this essential book,The Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter",Night and Day VHS

670857,"Ummmm... I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the people who are killing other humans and eating their flesh, genius.  Depending on your point of view, the above line either makes or breaks this film.  Were the filmmakers really trying to use this most heinous, exploitative, misogynistic, nauseating piece of cinema trash as a morality tale or were they intentionally being ironic?  Or perhaps they were pointing the finger at the kind of people who who enjoy this revolting piece of supposed entertainment.  ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is the kind of film that is cheered by folks who have spent hours of their lives on the internet looking for snuff films and videos of rapes.  What this film gives you is the most realistic over the top, uncalled-for phony snuff film ever made. The film is so graphic and realistically shot that the filmmakers were charged with murder and had to produce the film's actors in a court of law to exhonerate themselves of the charges.  This is a powerful, incredibly well made and original film that certainly inspired the ""Blair Witch Project"", but while ""Blair Witch"" managed to terrify by not showing you anything and letting the storytelling do it's job, ""Holocaust"" has a silly story and shows you EVERYTHING: genital mutilation, gang rape, forced abortions, more internal organs than you'd think could fit inside the human body and, of course, cannibalism.  And let us not forget the very real animal torture the viewer is forced to endure.  One furry jungle creature (incorrectly dubbed a ""muskrat"" by one character) is held up to the camera and carved up, writhing and screaming in pain, with a knife.  In another instance which almost caused me to vomit, a very large turtle is dragged out of the river and hacked apart with a hatchet, internal organs jiggling like so much gelatin and limbs still kicking.  There's also a shot of a monkey getting his face chopped off with a machette.  The real kicker there is that they messed up the first take and had to get another monkey to redo the shot.  I should also add that none of these sequences advance the plot in any way, they are there just to be ghoulish.  That's where the irony comes in; you see the theme of the film is about the impossibly unethical and downright disgusting ends the film's documentarians go to to get sensational shots for their film.  One could easily make the same claim about the folks behind ""Cannibal Holocaust"" regarding these authentic animal mutilations that we are forced to sit through as we view this movie.  So again I wonder if, by deliberately attempting to make this film a morality tale about how humans dehumanize each other, they were being ironic and putting one over on the idiots who would take that line about who the real cannibals are as some deep philosophical commentary on our society.  If so, bravo.  But I doubt that's the truth; I'm of the opinion that it was a lame attempt by the purveyors of this garbage to justify a film that only exists to be so utterly disturbing and vile that only those looking for the most hardcore gore they could find would ever even attempt to watch it.  I love gore and horror as much as anybody (hence my viewing of the film), but this film is waaaay over the line for me and unless watching a newborn pulled from its mother's womb and thrown into a hole and buried as the mother's head is smashed in with rocks or a woman being violated with a disturbingly large piece of wood and then killed is your idea of must-see TV, I can't recommend you ever come near this film.",N/A

I was surprised that this movie is actually a little worse than the one before it. To me their wasn't even much fighting in this movie. To me there was just guys in robot suits, screaming, shooting aimlessly upwards. When watching the two sequeals to the Matrix we forget how great a movie the first one was. It was groundbreaking and very entertaining. Somehow the sequels turned into something that belongs on the Sci Fi channel and not on the big screen. The two sequeals contained nothing but cheap acting that was overdramatic and it seemed like everyone was trying to hard. Some parts of these sequals I thought I was watching Star Trek. After watching these sequals i think it is better if we pretend that these were never created or were not realated in any way to the first Matrix. Seeing how terrible the sequals are, that should not be a hard task.",N/A

714277,"As a horror fan, I have been on a mission here lately to locate never before seen or obscure horror films that have slipped by me and have been next to impossible to find in any store here and are never shown on TV. The first was ""The House On Sorority Row"", which I got and wrote a review for. The next on my list was this film, ""The Prowler"", from 1981. Yes, 1981. The year most horror/slasher fans say was the pinnacle year for this subgenre of horror. I've heard many a slasher fan herald this film as one of the best, and I have heard many a horror fan say...well, not so much. I had always been curious about this little seen cult classic, and I finally tracked down and ordered a copy. My verdict?. Well, first thing's first....The movie opens with a great news reel showing troops returning home on boat from World War II. A nice and interesting opening. We begin in Avalon Bay, 1945. The night of the graduation dance. A female has just written to her war hero boyfriend a ""Dear John"" letter. A mysterious figure makes his presence known in brutally grotesque fashion in the opening minutes. Who is this guy?. Somebody gone crazy after the war?. The recipient of the 'Dear John' letter?. We flash forward 35 years to 1980, where the town is once again deciding to celebrate with a party, which had been banned ever since the horrible murders. We are introduced to a number of college co-eds and their boyfriends, a sheriff, a deputy, a town weirdo, and so on. And red herrings. Needless to say, someone is definitley not happy that the town has decided to throw a party again, and the body count begins to rise....""The Prowler"" was released the same year as ""My Bloody Valentine"", and both are similar in ways. Both had something tragic happen during a town event/dance, only for it to be banned. Cut to years later and the dance is resurrected and the killer returns to bump off people. This movie was directed by Joseph Zito, who would go on to bigger attention(and box office) with ""Friday The 13th IV : The Final Chapter"", which many consider to be the best sequel or just the best F13 film. You can see Zito putting to use here what he did in F134, only the latter was better. Zito does set some good tone and atmosphere here and there, and there are some great lighting and angle shots. Best of all, he lingers pretty well on all the violence and lets the red stuff flow and spurt and let's everyone see it in all it's glory. Of course, the praise for that goes to Tom Savini, another F13 vet, who would re-team with Zito on Part 4. The movie has had a reputation for being among Savini's best and most brutal work. I have to say that that part of the movie does not disappoint at all, especially a rather nasty death sequence in a pool. The best of the bunch. Elsewhere, Savini lets rip with multiple stabbings with long knives and, kind of bizarrely, a pitchfork. It works for me, but does seem kind of out of place. Savini showcases some of his best work here, but he has done just as good stuff in other films too. If that's what you are looking for, you shouldn't be disappointed. Despite some good work from Zito and great work from Savini, it's not enough to save the movie.So, Zito does some nice direction, and Savini delivers the goods. But does that make the movie?. It will surely satisfy the gorehounds, but the movie itself ends up being a disappointment. It's fun and entertaining in spots, and I like the opening minutes including the 1945 scenario and our introduction to the town and all that. Sadly, not too long after that the movie then slows down, and I came away from it feeling a bit underwhelmed. During the course of the film, our two main heroes decide to check out old, dark, creepy houses and dark cemeteries, trying to find out what's going on here. It certainly looks good and like it belongs in a horror movie, but there's little payoff to most of it. Just a lot of slowness with these two creeping around. Come to think of it, I think these two do more, ahem, ""prowling"", than the Prowler himself. The movie was really building to some momentum and more fun, but then it just immediatley comes to a halt with this detective stuff and some quick shots of the killer's boots. It lost some steam when it should of just been getting it. Also, the movie wasted some opportunities with other characters who one would assume were set up to be Prowler fodder. Unfortunatley, they go off and the viewer thinks ""Alright!. Here it comes!"" and then nothing. We don't see them again. Not only was it a letdown, but afterwards you wonder why they even bothered showing them in the first place in what felt like a set up for some red stuff and then just go off and leave them?. It was a bit odd and a waste of what could of shown more Savini magic. But hey, who ever said these movies usually make a lot of sense?. The Prowler himself is pretty creepy looking, all decked out in GI gear, but that doesn't extend to the characterization of the character. Needless to say, he's no Michael Meyers or Freddy Krueger.All in all, ""The Prowler"" is a mixed bag. It delivers the gore and the setting and atmosphere is quite nice, and Zito does get some nice shots and spooks, but it's all rolled up with a lot of time that slows the movie down quite a bit(I even nodded off once and that should never happen for me during a slasher movie!), odd scenes that don't have any satisfying conclusion, and a final reveal of the killer who may surprise some. The killer's identity was another problem. I don't recall there being any reason. Why was this person doing it?. Did I miss something?. Was this the guy that got the letter in the beginning or was he just some crazy kook?. Nothing was ever really explained. It was handled oddly, but the death scene was one of the most memorable. Acting-wise, some is passable, but mostly it's just average on most parts, and below average on others. Basically, your typical b-movie slasher performances. Hollywood veterans Farley Granger and Lawrence Tierney appear in this movie. Granger gets more screen time, while Tierney is in two scenes and has no dialogue and then just disappears. Another odd thing about the movie.So, ""The Prowler"" delivers in some areas, but it's by no means one of the best of the early 80s slashers. I like these kinds of movies, but even I came away disappointed. For myself, it didn't turn out to be one of the shining lights of the early slasher boom as others think it is. It's mildly entertaining, and easily watchable, but most of the praise goes to Savini and his great, bloody work. Like I said earlier, the set-up is similar to ""My Bloody Valentine"". The difference being that that movie was much, much better.",N/A

386913,"None other than the leftist fire breather Michael Moore lensed &quot;Canadian Bacon,&quot; a film that turned into a huge box office bomb. That should serve as the first warning to potential viewers interested in viewing this film. If it doesn't, many other red flags pop up as the movie unfolds. Apparently, some genius in Hollywood thought Moore's documentaries meant that the guy could do a feature film. Wrong. &quot;Canadian Bacon,&quot; while boasting an occasionally funny scene or two, is nothing more than propaganda served up on a celluloid bun. The film stars Alan Alda, Kevin Pollack, John Candy (in one of his last film performances, a fact in and of itself noteworthy for fans of the Canadian comedian), Rhea Perlman, Rip Torn, G.D. Spradlin, Stephen Wright, and a host of other familiar faces. With a cast like this, you would think the movie would be an outright tour de force. Wrong again. Before watching this film, you should probably join the National Rifle Association, vote Republican, or simply fly an American flag for a few weeks. Whatever you do, do something to offset this unpleasant slice of good old left wing hate.Alan Alda plays an American president in trouble with the voting public. With the end of the Cold War and the attendant downsizing of the defense industry, lots of red-blooded American citizens are now out of work, and unemployed workers tend to vote for the other guy. What is a corrupt politician to do? According to Moore, the solution lies in creating a new enemy against which the American people can rally. After a failed attempt to restart a conflict with the tottering Soviet Union, the president and his slimy advisors set their sights on Canada. Urged on by his National Security Advisor Stuart Smiley (Pollack) and General Richard Panzer (Torn), the president sets into motion a flurry of anti-Canadian measures. Before too long, the media joins the fray by broadcasting thinly veiled slurs against the Great White North. An ugly incident at a hockey game in Canada, where American Sheriff Bud Boomer (Candy) starts a riot when he casts an aspersion on Canadian beer, further stokes the fires back home. Everything is really starting to work in the president's favor: the voters rapidly forget about the nation's economic troubles and begin arming themselves to stave off a possible invasion from Canada.When a few Americans decide to take matters into their own hands and invade Canada themselves, the real trouble starts. Bud Boomer, his girlfriend Honey (Perlman), and a few other brain dead hicks sneak across the border to cause a little disturbance. When some Canadian cops interrupt the fun, the Americans flee back into the United States without realizing they left Honey behind. This mistake leads Boomer and his companions to reinvade Canada in search of their beloved woman, a mission loaded with lots of humorous situations comparing the stupidity and aggressiveness of Americans with the simplicity and friendliness of Canadians. Meanwhile, back in Washington, D.C., the evil corporate boss R.J. Hacker (Spradlin) spurs the White House on in their fake little war games. He tells Stuart Smiley that he sold the Canadians a doomsday device that has the capacity to launch American missiles at the former Soviet Union. Hacker will sell the code to defuse the weapon to the government for a paltry sum of a few billion dollars. What started out as a political ploy to carry the next election has suddenly turned into a scenario involving all out nuclear war.I am willing to overlook a bit of cant in a movie from time to time, but the avalanche of propaganda in &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; is simply a wonder to behold. Moore skewers everything he hates about America: guns, the military, corporations, the media, patriots, and just about everything else under the sun. R.J. Hacker comes off as a power mad lunatic, the politicians are manipulative cynics, and the movie tars the average American with a generous coating of stupidity and blind patriotism. The latter is surprising since Moore consistently presents himself as the mouthpiece of the downtrodden American worker. But there is the director himself in one scene of the movie, carrying an assault rifle and mouthing jingoistic platitudes about wiping out the Canadians as if to put an exclamation point on his messages. As difficult as it is to swallow these sequences of truly nauseating hate, the movie as a whole is even worse because it isn't funny. Sure, a few scenes made me laugh out loud: the CIA spook outlining the sinister secrets of Canada is a real hoot, as are several of the encounters between Boomer's &quot;army&quot; and Canadian citizens. Overall, however, the movie tanks due to its shrill tone.The American public knew better than to buy into this junk when the movie opened back in the mid 1990s. Moore's recent popularity has inspired a few revisionists to resurrect this mediocre effort in order to sing its praises. Most people who speak about &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; now refer to its prescience concerning the existing administration in the White House--and do so without a trace of irony--as though America's forty-second president didn't try and distract the public from his scandal plagued regime by launching missiles into Afghanistan and Africa. I admit Moore scores some points in this movie, but those barbs jab both ways, folks. Watch &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; for a few select scenes and try to ignore the movie as a whole.",Canadian Bacon VHS

534830,"Many viewers were blown away by Cast Away, but I was not one of them. Much of the enjoyment of the movie depends on whether or not you are a Tom Hanks fan. I'm not all that impressed by him, and I assume that puts me in the minority. I believe the terms 'actor' and 'star' are not interchangeable. There have always been stars who are also consummate actors; however, one does not need a broad range of acting skills in order to be a star - or, for that matter, to win awards. Hanks is a star of the first magnitude. He can 'open' a picture because his legions of fans are going to flock to anything he is in. He likes to be in different kinds of movies, but, no matter what he is in, I am always aware that I am watching Tom Hanks.This time he plays Chuck Noland, a revved-up, stressed out manager at FedEx. He flies all over the world helping to make the package delivery giant ever more efficient. He is obsessed with time. It is Christmas, and he is about to ask Kelly [Helen Hunt] to marry him. Even this important moment is interrupted when he is called away for yet another flight to solve another company emergency. This time he doesn't make it. The plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, manages to make it to a deserted island. He is trapped in a place where time becomes irrelevant. Even his watch doesn't work. His survival tools are limited to a motley assortment of FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. Now he must learn whether or not the survival skills he honed in civilization will have any use in a place where civilization has no meaning.The production values are high in Cast Away. The plane crash, for example, is terrifyingly realistic and filled with first-rate special effects. Its the high point of the movie, but I don't think that's what its makers intended. The part where Noland is marooned on the island is well photographed and succeeds in capturing the character's utter aloneness and his descent into madness It is also a very long sequence, running nearly an hour and a half. After a while, there is only so much you can do with a character who has only a soccer ball to talk to. It was so long that it gave me time to think about how I was watching a very rich star doing a good impression of someone trapped on a deserted island. I began to picture Hank's big air-conditioned trailer and the mounds of gourmet food that lurked just out of camera range.Anyone who saw Cast Away's trailer knows whether Noland makes it off the island or not. For those who did not see it, I won't give away the ending. I will say that it is one the oddest and least inspired ones I've seen in a long time.",N/A

I thought ""The Legend of the Vampire"" was a surprisingly good return to form. Onto chapter six. I can't really say this is one of Scooby's better movies. It kind of lacks the punch and surprises of ""Zombie Island"" and ""The Witch's Ghost."" Instead of the scarey surprises seen in the first two movies, this 6th chapter seems to rely more on silly chases. (But if you like the original episodes, you probably won't mind that so much.) Also, in my opinion, the script is weaker which means the movie seems very long and drawn out. (""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost"" don't seem to have many dull moments at all.) And, I won't say too much here, but when the mystery is uncovered and you really didn't get to know the culprit in the first place, a certain edge is missing. (In ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost,"" we got to know the culprits very well in the 1st half of the movie, and therefore, there was  a scarey sense of recognition when the plots were uncovered. The main reason I can give to watch this movie is that it was at least nice to the original line up from the early cartoons (Casey Kasem-Shaggy, Frank Welker-Fred, Heather North-Daphne, and Nicole Jaffee-Velmah) together again. The movie is worth some interest, but it's more of a long episode. If you like Scooby, this movie is watchable. But, don't expect the terror, intensity, and suspense of ""Zombie Island,"" ""The Witch's Ghost,"" or even ""Legend of the Vampire.""",Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico

The love between Rowena and Ivanhoe is barely mentioned, in fact Anthony Andrews flat character rarely shows up in the film.The movie has been politicized...apparently the writers were more concerned with using the characters of Isaac and Rebecca to portray jews as superior and Christians asinferior and barbaric (this theme appears many times throughout the movie) than making a good film.The Robert Taylor version of this movie is MUCH better if what you want is a good swashbuckling yarn true to Sir Walter Scott's original Ivanhoe.",N/A

This film was borrowed and in my possession for quite a while and it took me months to finally watch it for free. It just had no appeal for me and actually lived up (or is that down?) to my low expectations.If I wanted a political movie, I'd look for a documentary. This was basically Cameron's liberal views glossed over by colorful characters and scenes. Apparently audiences really are dumbed down if they find this drivel so entertaining. I still hold out hope that most of the movie going public wants more sophistication in their films. I have to wonder though, when so many folks are apparently so easily entertained by a film because of somewhat stunning visuals and unnecessarily foul language.Without the visuals, what kind of film are we left with?",N/A

After the zombies show up is when things start getting sillier and sillier.  Example: the main guy is being attacked, in his home, by zombies from the front and the back so he lowers his head then raises his pistols and shoots in two directions at once like he was Christian Bale in EQUILIBRIUM and if that's not bad enough he then jumps in the air, flips upside down, jams his spurs (!?) into the wall above the doorway and literally swings back and forth shooting zombies.If that and lots of CGI effects sounds cool to you then by all means check it out, but I have no desire to ever see it again.",UNDEAD

Having said that, this film blows the idea so out of proportion that it is pretty much unbearable. Practically every scene that takes place in the terminal itself forces a brand name in your face and it's just a constant reminder of what remains most important in Hollywood nowadays. An argument could be made that all those stores exist in real terminals, but the way they are placed in the center of every scene just becomes too much. They include burger king, starbucks, borders books, yoshinoya, discovery channel store, and there's a few more.

1141731,"As most reviews have described the plot/premise of this film I won't do it here or frankly waste my time. Daniel Waters assembled what appears to be a promising and very talented cast. He under-utilized them all. The movie's opening scene starts with Mindy Cohen (""Fact of Life"") who was so nice to see after such a long absence. Of course, my smile turned to ""depression"" as I thought, ""Oh my... Mindy looks old!""  LOL That sums up my reaction to this film. I wanted to smile, immerse myself in the film, but in a flash that feeling would disappear.This disjointed movie trys to be too many things on too many levels. Serious, funny, fantasy, dark, and ironic- it falls short on all topics. All the actors simply appear to meandering their parts. The movie is simply too muted in ambiance to be outstanding in any one aspect. The director should have either decided to rev up Winona's plot and morphed it into a suspense movie or taken the 180 degree turn and created a full-fledged comedy. I believe it would have worked better that way. Even the scenes I thought ""This is funny and I should be laughing,"" I could barely crack a smile. Mr. Waters' direction just didn't give me the energy to.Winona Ryder- always a pleasure to watch- disappointed in this film with her mostly one-dimensional character that took such an unexpected radical twist. The ""1+2=3"" aspect of that just didn't work for me or give me a complete understanding as to ""How did this happen?"". When I find myself clock-watching a film within the first half hour, I know it's in trouble. Mr. Waters didn't give me any vested interest in the characters or what their ultimate fates would be. The movie just didn't find an ""identity"" for me that I could attach to and enjoy it from there. Every once in awhile it would have a brief spark of brillence, but like a straw fire, it was gone in a instant. Even Simon Baker's monologue at the end that tried to ""sum up"" the movie and give us a ""philsophical life lesson"" falls flat. I'm actually happy there are reviewers that came to appreciate the film for the actors' sake. Sad to say I cannot be one of them.",Sex And Death 101
422513,"I remember seeing this as the bottom part of a double-feature when I was nine years old.  And while I knew it was a low budget movie, I figured I would give it another shot.  I decided to watch the dvd with the audio commentary by two of the major special effects guys at ILM.  It was the first time I can remember an audio commentary wherein the commentators knew very little about the film they were talking about.  They were wrong about the year it was released (1959) and did not know the name of the star of the film (Gene Evans) although they did admit to seeing him before.  Most of their commentary was talking about the endless padding needed to bring this film to its almost 90 minute length, since the film did not have the budget for many special effects and as a result the monster was seen very infrequently.  They described how boring it must have been for a 12 year old to sit through this film.  (I was nine and don't really remember being tremendously bored.)  I did enjoy them comparing this film to some of Harryhausen's although they did throw Spielberg's name in for some reason, I guess to show us that they were two of the major special effects technicians on ""Jurassic Park.""  I wish they would have discussed the director's (Eugene Lourie) next giant monster film ""Gorgo"" a little more.  I've always enjoyed that film.As for the film itself, the special effects are pretty poor in this black and white film.  If you want a pretty mediocre sci. fi film from the '50s, but a fairly good indication of the type of low budget sci. fi. extravaganzas they made in those days, then you will enjoy this film.  I grew up during this period and loved the sci. fi., horror and fantasy films of my childhood.  However, I'll take ""Godzilla,"" ""Gorgo"" or any of Harryhausen's films over this one any day.",The Giant Behemoth VHS
71223,"Yes, this is a real gobbler of a movie, but it might have been okay if it were not just another vehicle for Arnold Schwartzenegger.  Arnold, whose emotional range goes from A to B even at the best of times, displays his complete lack of any acting ability at all in a manner that begs the question why Peter Hyams bothered to make the movie at all.  Someone else in the role of Jericho might have been able to make the picture work, but it would have to have been someone of the caliber of Spencer Tracy or perhaps Rod Steiger-- who plays a minor supporting role-- in order to do it.  Poor Mr. Steiger looks embarrassed to be in the film, as well he might.  The movie is an embarrassment to everyone in it.  Except Arnold possibly, and only because when one's only acting method is a gun, everything looks like a shooting range target.  Arnold shoots his guns a lot and grimaces, which is pretty standard.  That said, there are some things that do work fairly well in this movie.  Gabriel Byrne does just fine as the incarnate Satan.  He has some fine moments in the film.  He is pretty much the only one, however, who gets fine moments.  There is a great scene with Jericho and the  incarnate Evil One, where Evil tries to buy Jericho's cooperation.  It is totally wasted with Arnold as the tormented alcoholic hero, because Arnold has no emotional range, but one can see by Gabriel Byrne's attempts to give Arnold something to play off of, that almost any other actor could have made that scene work. One can see a structure there that had potential; alas, however, completely wasted.  Robin Tunney, the damsel in distress, does her best but there is no sense that she is in  desperate self-conflict.  This is absolutely essential to the emotional impact of the story, but it is completely absent.  She screams a lot and looks moderately fetching, and that's about it.  Although the pretense and the rationale for the whole story is contrived and silly, this in itself is not enough to make a movie a failure.  It fails because of the actors [Arnold the hero and Robin Tunney the heroine] and is a textbook example of how important a professional performance is to a film. Without it, a movie like this is all boom and crash, growl and magazine click, grunt and obscene finger gestures-- not worth your time or your money, unless you use it to study failure and learn from it.",N/A

506472,"Shooting at just under two hours, this is one of those films where you nearly feel winded after watching it in its entirety.  Not that it is a ""bad"" thing to have so much happening in just a short amount of time, but with Grace of My Heart it felt like a solid blow to the gut.  The lack of air, the ""whoosh"" of intense pain, and the increased blurred vision due to the excitement of the punch were all experiences that I had while watching this film.  For those that can sit here and claim that this was a perfect film, I really beg to differ, but I will be a very brave advocate towards the ""originally average"".  This means that there were elements that I completely loved, followed in suit by elements that made me awaken at night in a pool of my own sweat.  Grace of My Heart was one of those classic cinematic tug-o-wars that ultimately ended in a stalemate, but had fans on either side waiting for the final results.Beyond the cryptic comparisons that I make above, there were moments of honesty, especially when I was thinking about the elements that worked and those that did not.  You cannot talk about this film without giving Anders the credit that she deserves for the music.  This film could not have survived without the talent that was behind the musical moments.  The energy, emotion, and cultural independence were ravishing.  Literally, it could take your breath away and you wouldn't have even realized it.  It set the tone and created the atmosphere for this film.  As a viewer, you could close your eyes, ignore the spoken words of this film, and get completely lost in the music.  The way that Anders incorporated established, modern singers to bring this era of the 50s, 60s, and 70s to life were brilliant.  She deserved the accolades that followed the musical footsteps of this film, sadly ... I don't think she quite had a firm grip on the rest of the story.What I mean by this is that while the songs established the film, the story and characters hurt it. Illeana Douglas does exceptionally well with the material presented to her, but she just doesn't quite drag you into her life.  You never quite feel as if you are right there with her experiencing her sorrows, excitements, and pain as she trudges through this man-infested life of hers.  You watch her go through the motions, but you never feel that tear erupt or couch-excitement brew.  It just doesn't happen, and why ... because 1) she never ages throughout the course of 20ish years (only gets thinner and thinner) 2) her voice is semi-whiney through the entire film causing us to feel like she was a bit sour and finally, 3) her consistent need for a man in her life.  This latter I blame Anders.  She never defines Waverly's character throughout the film.  Is she a feminist?  Is she as independent as we all thought?  Does she create or simply steal from other's misfortunes?  These are simple questions that should have been answered throughout the film, but instead we are nearly forced to explode (as stated before) as more and more information is jammed down our vision.  It is nearly sickening.  While Illeana doesn't carry the weight of disaster completely on her own shoulders, there are other characters that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film.  Bruce Davison and Matt Dillon seemed to be completely miscast in their respective roles, again constantly reminding us that we were watching a film, not immersing ourselves in a vivid story.The only character that I can give credit towards is John Turturro's Joel Millner.  Turturro took his ""bit"" part to a new level always giving enough so that we constantly waited for him to reappear on screen.  He was like an animated cartoon that brought more to the screen than any of the other characters mentioned above.  That is sad to see for a film of this caliber, but it is what occurred.  So, you take the grandiose excitement of the music and couple it with some sub-par acting and what do you get?  Grace of My Heart in its purest form.Overall, it is never good to use more than one Fonda in your film.  If you find yourself going with more than one, you should really be reconsidering your options.  Matt Dillon completely ruined this film for me, while my keen eye had a blast picking out today's artists in this film.  I just wish more was developed with Douglas' character.  Why did she continually fall into love with the wrong men?  Did anyone else catch that her creative songs were developed from the suffering of others?  Finally, why did we bring up her family's fortune if it was never used throughout the film?  I kept waiting for her to use her family money to build upon the climax of the film, but it never happened.  I felt cheated, as I did several times during this film.  It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it just wouldn't stand out in a crowd.  Grace of My Heart is the wallflower of the cinematic world.Grade: ** out of *****",Grace of My Heart

The underlining doesn`t stop there, however, for  Jeff Renfroe""s direction is filled with any number of hokey touches, including panning wildly or having the camera do virtual somersaults anytime anything even remotely sinister or suspenseful is about to take place on screen.The movie first points out how the media, obsessed with profits and ratings, finds it necessary to bombard us with a steady stream of potential terror threats, both real and manufactured, on an around-the-clock basis - and then questions what kind of effect such sensory overload might have on an already unstable personality.

The quiet essence of teenage angst that Clowes captured so brilliantly in his monochromatic drawings is lost somewhere in the translation.Not that the movie can't be assused of not trying...director Zwigoff just tries so hard he almost belittles his audience's intelligence. Its as though he used Clowes' basic characterization and plot structure to present his own frustrations with society, art, and cinema. Zwigoff uses the relationship between characters as a foil to the frustration of the creative individual in such a regimented market-driven country. I don't have issue with this per se...it just follows the trappings of the 'American Beauty' syndrome: soulful frustrated characters drifting through mediocrity with convenient typical ultra-liberal Hollywood plot twists.Parodied situations in this vein are throughout 'Ghost World'.

You know basically everything that will happen from start to finish. There's no surprise, no smiles and no effort at being more than it is.The movie even suffers from ""End Credit Blooper Syndrome"", which is how you know the filmmakers even knew this was a turkey and figured they might try to solicit a few cheap laughs from you as you leave the theatre in hopes you might remember those cheap laughs and not all the time you spent looking at your watch.I'm at work now and bought this across the street in order to provide myself with some minor amusement. Sadly, even that minor level of amusement eluded me.This film centers around twelve extremely selfish and self-centered children who sabotage their father's efforts at having a career and trying to be a good parent. In doing so, he's managed to secure a huge pay raise, a much larger house and free college for his children. The bastard!Of course, the movie would have you believe that what's really going on is that the father is a Bad Man because he dares to try to have a career and tries to help out his wife so that she can have a career as well (strangely her having a career is not presented as any kind of a problem).This movie is what I would categorize as a ""KOMEDY!"". It's different from a ""comedy"", because in a comedy people do things that make sense and flow logically from what's been happening up to that point. In a KOMEDY! people do things because the script says they do.Case in point: in one scene the children soak someone's underwear in a pile of meat. In the real world, a: someone would have noticed what looks like several pounds of ground meat walking away, and b: no one would be stupid enough to put on underwear that smells of ground meat.Basically this a movie I endured, rather than watched (still better than something like the American version of ""Godzilla"", which can merely be survived and requires a long period of painful recovery afterwords). Steve Martin is a good actor and very funny, and he's the only reason this film gets two stars rather than one (well, and Tom Welling and Ashton Kutcher walking around in not many clothes helps).It's a pity, cause as I said, the basic plot idea here is a good one.

534520,"The Coen Brothers bring the story of Homer's The Odyssey into the twentieth century in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and the result is a mixed bag.  The film follows Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) through Mississippi during the Depression years as they come into contact with a number of colorful characters and situations.  The Coens do a wondeful job of capturing the mood of the era by populating the film with bluegrass music and images of chain gangs, cotton fields, hobos, and bogus medicines, but these assorted elements never mesh.  The film seems to be just a jumble of component parts that don't add up to anything when put together.  There's a semblance of a story at the outset when McGill recuits his two cohorts to help him find a hidden treasure but this story thread becomes lost among a Klan rally, an encounter with sirens, meetings with pompous politicans, and a picnic with a Bible salesman.  I realize the point of the film is to chronicle the adverturesome trials and travails of the journey from point A to point B, but the stops along the way just aren't interesting enough to keep you involved.  When the journey concludes, you feel unsatisfied because there wasn't a grand pay-off that justified the time you invested in the film.  The bottom line is that ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is filled with wonderful music and visuals but is frustratingly empty in the substance department.  Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson all give good acting turns but their efforts feel wasted.  When Ulysses Everett McGill yells ""Damn!

The whole gist of the script relied on a chance encounter with a dead girl's ghost in the middle of a country road and an ensuing possession of Halle Berry's body.  How much further off the beaten track can you get?  That sequence of events had NO RELATIONSHIP to what had happened in the film thus far.  It was like ""black fly in your chardonnay"", to borrow from Alanis Morrisette.  So obtuse and obtrusive, it made the rest of the film dismal to watch.  Plus the ending had offensive twists and turns that were unbelievable and disconnected.  I think the best description of this script and direction is Head Cheese.The only reason it gets even TWO STARS is for Berry's performance.  She took a shoddy script and made it work the best she could.",N/A
1127016,"AWAKE would be better named 'audience wake up' as the minimal novel idea of the story loses credibility so quickly that the development of the subplots become increasingly tedious and silly.  Joby Harold both wrote and directed this film and despite the presence of some fine actors, the film remains grounded.Clay Beresford (Hayden Christensen) has inherited his dead father's multi-billion dollar fortune and shares the wealth and control of his empire with his domineering mother Lilith (Lena Olin). Clay apparently has a genetically determined cardiac pathology, is medicated, and awaits a heart transplant. The only semblance of honest life Clay has is his love for his mother's secretary Sam (Jessica Alba) who, despite Lilith's objections, marries Clay after disclosing their relationship.  Clay's beeper warning that a cardiac donor is available cuts short their night of honeymoon and Clay is rushed to the hospital to his constant friend, Dr. Jack Harper (Terrence Howard), who just happens to be a heart transplant surgeon and who Clay prefers over Dr. Neyer (Arliss Howard),  the superior cardiac surgeon friend of his mother who has been the designated surgeon all along. The gimmick of the film is 'anesthetic awareness', a state of anesthesia when the patient is paralyzed but aware of the talk in the OR as well as the pain of the surgery. What Clay hears 'under anesthesia is a ridiculous, convoluted plot involving all the people he thought he could trust and about which he can do nothing: in order to keep the storyline rolling, the script gives him an out of body experience so that Clay can be his own detective in solving the myriad discrepancies of his situation.  The ending is very predicable and begs viewer indulgence.Perhaps the credibility of this story would have been better if the director and actors had paid more attention to OR technique: walking into an OR in street clothes, handling patients without gloves or masks, allowing outsiders to enter the OR during a transplant procedure, beginning surgery without documentation of complete anesthesia or before the donor heart arrives, etc. etc. etc. are such breaches of surgical rules that even the casual viewer of TV medical dramas knows.  But the real problem with the script is that we are left caring very little for any of the characters, despite the fact the roles are assigned to some heavy hitters! Sadly, the movie is just silly.

904515,"A brother and sister team are biten by a werewolf that then stalks them. I'm usually a fan of Wes Craven, but he missed by a mile on this one.This is a hugely flawed story. The brother and sister are biten by a werewolf, but still run when it shows up. Why? What are they afraid of, aren't they already cursed?Then there is the flaw of the werewolf that made them wanting to destroy them? Why did he turn them to werewolves in the first place if he just wanted to kill them? Didn't he make killing them harder by turning them into something supernatual? He could have just killed them in the beginning.Also, Craven strays from the werewolf legend by making the werewolves retain their control and ability to reason when morphed into full werewolf. It would be scarier to make the werewolves into out of control creatures that mindlessly kill without reason.There were a couple attempts at humor that did not help the story and came across as cheesy.

I can say, after finally seeing it, that it was terribly over-hyped and as a vampire flick? Terrible.These are not your run of the mill vampires. And I knew that before I saw it. They do not die in the sunlight. They do not have fangs. All in all, they're just cold, strong and fast humans. The only thing that REALLY connects them with the ""classic"" vampires is their thirst for blood, which isn't really a big thing in the movie either. If Edward did not look at her neck longingly with the occasional mention of wanting her blood, you'd never really know.As for the love story of the movie. The pacing is terrible. They meet in class and do not even speak to one another. They have few interactions where they actually talk. Next thing you know, they're confessing their love for each other. No development there. It's like they just decided during one of their brief walk by conversations to be in love.I suppose if you're a die-hard fan of the books, you may appreciate the movie.

However, Kevin Costner's portrayal of a conflicted father was definitely not ""academy award"" material, and many of the characters introduced and plot twists went nowhere.

1129848,"One of the first adult novels I ever read was ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", and it helped introduce me to a whole world of historical fiction, despite the mixed opinions about it. I, like so many others, was far less than impressed with the Hollywood adaptation with Natalie Portman and Eric Bana, so when I found this I thought I had finally found a decent version. Surely, of all people, the BBC would get this right, wouldn't they? Unfortunately, no.While it is a bit more faithful to the novel, and I do like the casting better (this was Tudor times; Mary and Anne were not ""Hollywood"" stunning*) there are too many low points to make this a decent movie.- Firstly, and the most terrible of all, is that for some unfathomable reason this film is shot like a documentary. Anne and Mary actually talk to the camera as if they're on Real World: England; there is even an instance where one of the sisters goes running across the castle grounds in her nightshift, and the camera not only goes to night vision, it is pointed at the ground!- The costumes are absolutely terrible. Mary's teal gable hood is a complete disaster, with a strange, stiff white bit that honestly looks like a piece of plastic. They truly look like sometime from a cheap costume shop.- Mary is depicted as being the conspirator behind George and Anne's incest, which is also depicted as having happened. While one might argue that this is fiction after all, if we are following the book series continuity, it is proved in ""The Boleyn Inheritance"" that Jane Parker lied out of spite.- Henry literally gives not one care upon hearing the news that Mary has given birth to a son, due to his newfound infatuation with Anne. Let me just say that again. A King, a man who had the whole country in celebration for the birth of his first born (bastard) son and is constantly praying for another, barely blinks an eye at the news that his mistress has just given birth to a healthy baby boy. We all know Henry, that simply would not have happened.- I don't know what kind of camera they filmed this with, but the entire film is terribly grainy.- THE ENDING. Remember how I mentioned that it's shot like a documentary? The film ends with modern day footage of tourists around the memorial where the executions took place while Mary does a voice over stating that her brother and sister went to the scaffold after being declared guilty. That's it. No heart wrenching speech before Anne loses her head, nothing.- The romance between Mary and William Stafford is so sudden, it seems like some sort of Romeo and Juliet situation, having barely known each other before getting married.I could probably go on and on about all the things wrong about this film, but then my review would be as tedious to read as this movie was to watch. The only part I actually enjoyed was Anne's temper showing through when she sat at Henry's side and asked Henry which of the women in the room was his ""syphilitic whore."" It shows you how Anne (the Gregory Anne) went from a girl who only ever wanted to be happy to a power hungry woman desperate to keep her bum firmly planted on the throne.*You may argue that the casting of the Showtime show ""The Tudors"" has some pretty beautiful women playing the parts of Henry's queens, but we at least get to see them at vulnerable times, sometimes with their eyes red and puffy, faces covered in sweat and dirt, and at hideous low points in their lives. If I recall correctly, not a hair was out of place on Scarlet Johansson's head after giving birth to Catherine.",The Other Boleyn Girl
380296,"I love the Friday the 13th films. My brother and I snuck into the first one when it was in theaters and I have been a faithful follower of the series since then. I have owned all of the films on VHS, bought the individual DVD's as they came available, and broke down and bought the box set when it first appeared just for the meager extras that were included. I love these movies. With that said, I only recommend ""Jason Goes to Hell"" if you are a completist and need the entire series on DVD. It's no wonder it took a decade after this film for ""Jason X"" to come out, as New Line nearly killed the series here. Fans of the series go to these films for basically one reason....to see Jason do his slasher thing with a forest full of annoying kids. That's it, we don't need a deep plot, we don't even really need an explanation of how Jason is resurrected once again, just have him show up and start chopping in more imaginative ways. So why New Line decided to launch their version of a Friday the 13th film where Jason is only in two scenes makes no sense at all! The plot of this film is a direct rip-off of a flick called ""The Hidden"", but intstead of an alien body-jumping, we get an evil worm thing. To top it all off, while this is a gory flick at times, it is also a very talky flick. The body count is pretty low until the last 15 minutes or so, and by then it's too late to try and save this thing. I see other reveiwers lumping this flick in with ""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"", and while I understand their reasoning, I say New Beginning at least keeps the action moving with a HUGE bodycount and at least tries to capture the flavor of a ""Friday"" movie, ""Goes to Hell"" does not. I can see myself popping this thing in every 5 or 6 years or so, just because it's so forgettable I won't remember why I haven't seen it in so long...only to be reminded again at a later date just why this movie collects so much dust sitting on my shelf.",N/A
1079495,"In this forum, I gave the first two Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collections five stars each because I was ecstatic to have the classic shorts in a handy form for on-demand viewing. Many reviewers were slamming the occasional minor edits, but I tried to see the forest for the trees. I'm an enthusiastic fan but not really a passionate collector, so I don't get too upset about little edits by the current DVD producers, regardless of the wisdom behind their decisions. But this time I'm siding with the critics because Time Warner has no idea what it's doing. First of all, Spotlight Collection #3 has simpler packaging and fewer bonus features than its predecessors, indicating a lack of consistency and enthusiasm from Time Warner. Most importantly, the two completely deleted episodes are a travesty, because the back of this box says that #3 ""is the final release of the William Hanna and Joseph Barbera Era Theatrical Shorts on DVD."" So Time Warner has decided that we won't get two episodes. Yes, the issue is those crude old racial stereotypes, which I (and everyone else) know are wrong. But Time Warner has handled the issue disastrously.As a kid in the 1970s I watched the Tom & Jerry classics with my mother and grandmother, who could recall watching the originals back in the 40s and 50s. Very early on they informed me that those nasty racial caricatures were ignorant, and I never gave those stereotypes any consideration while enjoying the artistry and hilarity of the classic cartoons. Therefore it is not necessary for Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Turner to tell me what to think of them three decades later. Anyone stupid enough to convert old stereotypes into modern bigotry is not in the market demographic for these DVDs. Time Warner should know who their customers are - collectors and serious fans who desire historical completeness and who know that the racial caricatures should be disregarded. We do not need Time Warner to tell us what's right or wrong because we already know. This is especially pathetic when compared to the standard sex, violence, and bowdlerization that appear all over Time Warner's modern programming, and that stuff is even being done to people rather than animated animals.Granted, there are still plenty of classics in this package and fans will love watching them again and again. For that reason Spotlight Collection #3 gets two stars. But Time Warner is guilty of incompetent business practices when it creates a collector-oriented product, but forgets about those enthusiastic customers while trying to appease moralists who wouldn't even think of buying the product in the first place. The jeers are deserved. [~doomsdayer520~]",Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection: Vol. 3

1102342,"**1/2Recent college grad Annie Braddock (Scarlett Johansson) is all set for a career in business when she quite literally falls into a position as nanny for the four-year-old son (Nicholas Art) of a snooty, self-absorbed Upper East Side socialite named Alexandra X, played by a sadly miscast Laura Linney (among many of the movie`s wearisomely cutesy touches is not giving a surname to the family that hires her).Based on the novel by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus, ""The Nanny Diaries"" is, unfortunately, every bit as predictable and trite as its simpleminded premise would lead one to expect.  Beyond trafficking in just about every stereotype and clich&eacute; imaginable - the heartless, neurotic, slave-driving elitists; the sensitive knight-in-shining armor love interest (Chris Evans); the nagging, free-living best friend; the lecherous, nanny-chasing husband (Paul Giamatti) - the movie is woefully unsuccessful even at treading that fine line between cleverness and cuteness that can make or break a film of this type.  There is an affectionate tribute to ""Mary Poppins"" that - early on at least - suggests that the movie might actually try to do something a little daring, a little different.  But that air of fanciful creativity is quickly squelched in favor of formulaic storytelling and cookie cutter characterizations.Interestingly, the filmmakers, for all their championing of the women employed as nannies, seem to have almost as low an opinion of the profession itself as do the elite snobs who appear on screen.All told, Johansson is really the only decent thing about ""The Nanny Diaries"" (well, little Nicholas Art is pretty cool too), but even her staunchest admirers would be well advised to look the other way when it comes to this film.",N/A

143874,"&#34;Carrie&#34; is a curio from late 70's horror offerings, so it is worth watching once--if only to see how little quality that the script actually has. King's source novel provided a fairly good blueprint, but so much has been altered and left out that the real shock of the story is left circumspect as opposed to being a close interpretation. Piper Laurie thought her role was meant to be satirical, so she sort of overplays her part to a fault, bless her. Horror IS supposed to be close to satire, but unfortunately neither King nor De Palma understand how to handle it very well. Travolta has a thankless (and angering) role, helping teen slut Nancy Allen harm animals and screw up the high school prom for the sake of humiliating an already pitiful-looking girl. Sissy Spacek is a fine actress (did you ever see &#34;Badlands&#34;?), but here she is trying to support this whole anti-idea enterprise upon her little shoulders alone. Also, the story has little to say, not to mention anywhere to go. I simply don't see the point--as a horror film, it is incomplete, and as social commentary, it's too close to genre leanings to ever be literary (in any sense).

What a waste of time -- This was a terrible movie!The storyline is almost identical to the 1st ""American Pie"". 3 Guys make a pack to lose their virginity. Although similar, there is one major difference in this film when compared to the original. This time the Sex Bible (originally shown in ""American Pie 1"") is the central part the storyline. Yes the same book that Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) discovers in the Great Falls high school library and uses to sexually please Vicky (Tara Reid) in her bedroom. The book has been partially destroyed in a flood (due to fire sprinklers being set off after a small fire.) Now the 3 main characters (of this film) are on a mission to restore the book and lose their virginity at the same time.There are lots of familiar scenes in this film that are almost identical to the original ""American Pie"" including several references to sex with Food items, animals, and household appliances. Also there are several scenes where the main character's sex life is exposed on the internet (sound familiar?). Furthermore, we have another Stiffler who is oddly similar to the original character created by Seann William Scott but not portrayed as well. And if that is not enough, the film also includes a foreign exchange student (Nadia's cousin) although her part is small and unclear as to what she actually adds to the storyline.Basically if You have seen the original ""American Pie"", and maybe ""Hot Dog... The Movie"" (due to some similar ski lodge scenes) then you have seen this movie. Wish I could give a better review to this one, but it was just not that great of a Pie movie (unlike the last few released.) Maybe they should have stayed within the newer storyline they created with ""American Pie presents The Naked Mile"", and ""American Pie presents Beta House"". At least these two movies were actually worth watching more then once.The only slightly interesting aspect of this movie is the assorted guest appearances by former child stars, rock stars, and Classic Television stars. Some of those include Dustin Diamond (Skreech), C. Thomas Howell, Christopher Knight (Peter Brady), Tim Matheson, Bret Michaels (Poison), Kevin Federline (Britney Spears Ex-husband), Sherman Hemsley (The Jeffersons), Steve Railsback, and a few others.

1015083,"I regret having purchased this particular DVD.  I love Sarah's concert DVDs and her audio CDs, but found this video collection for the most part very tacky.  She deserves better video directors who have a more coherent, dignified vision for canvassing her music.  And perhaps Sarah could come up with better visual ideas as well.  While the use of juxtaposition can work sometimes, when it doesn't work, it's horrid.  A big gamble there.One of the few videos I found interesting was ""Captain Nemo.""  It's multi-layered, and actually has something to do with the subject matter expressed by the lyrics.  I found the video of ""Ave Maria"" too obtuse to be interesting; how did being naked with scattered applications of gold leaf relate to the material?  It's a silly, irreverent approach.Most of the older videos unfortunately have not aged well; Ken Russell's contributions, especially.  While some see Russell as a visionary, I have often found his work to be rather sloppy and uninspiring.I found the interviews quite interesting and enjoyed hearing Sarah's take on them, but would have preferred the option of having the videos play with or without the commentaries for repeated listening.By the way, what's up with the Blair Witch camera man who can't stay still during the commentaries?  Argh!  Sit down and get a tripod, for Pete's sake!  One could get seasick while viewing.  And at one point where the camera simply goes in vertical circles like a Ferris wheel, or pauses to focus on her breasts, it's downright embarrassing.  Tacky, tacky, tacky.Speaking of breasts, I'm no prude (I find nudity to be quite natural), but I am always put-off by singers who feel the need to present themselves as whorish maidens, tawdry vixens, or outright sluts in steamy attire with coy, ""come hither"" expressions.  With incredible vocal talent like Sarah's (or Mariah Carey's), there's no need to shock people with a willingness to be naked or partially clad.  It detracts from a reputation as serious musical artists.  If I wanted a pin-up girl, I'd subscribe to Playboy.  I'm all about the music!So to the music I'll return, and leave future video collections in the bin until I see better visual images more deserving of Sarah's wonderful talent.NOTE: Instead, check out her concert videos ""La Luna"" and ""Harem.""  They're much more imaginative and entertaining than most of what you'll find in these music videos.  Definitely worth a look!",N/A

964360,"I was disappointed with this longer version of The Mill on the Floss.  I thought, being BBC and a long version it would be a definitive one, but I have to agree with the other reviewer.  This version left out some very important events, and emotions seemed washed out rather than passionate and moving. I like long movies, but this dragged because it just doesn't hold your attention.  The 1997 Masterpiece Theatre version is so much more powerful, and keeps all important events intact, spending less time on Maggie's mother worrying about the fate of her china, and more on character and plot development, with a very haunting score.  I really hope the other version is released on DVD-if so, I will probably donate this one to the library, because I can't quite see myself rewatching it. I would rather read the book, instead.",N/A
799178,"**1/2 ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is the much-anticipated conclusion to the Wachowski Brothers' cultic sci-fi trilogy, whose previous entries were ""The Matrix"" and ""The Matrix Reloaded.""  In the series' final installment, the messiah figure, Neo, does battle with the diabolical forces that have imprisoned most of humanity in a world of cyber unreality via a massive computer program known as The Matrix.Of the three films, ""Revolutions"" is definitely the least imaginative and the least interesting.  What separated the first two episodes in the series from most other action films was the willingness on the part of the filmmakers to bring some thematic depth and narrative complexity to a genre that, all too often, finds no room for such qualities.  The previous two films didn't always succeed in their endeavor - often emerging as more hollow and pretentious than meaningful and profound - but they managed to remain intriguing even in their moments of failure.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for ""Revolutions,"" which spends so much time on repetitive action scenes and special effects that there is little time left over for storyline and theme.  In a strange way, Neo himself ends up getting lost in this film, dropping off the radar screen for astonishingly long stretches of time, only to re-emerge periodically to remind us that there really is supposed to be a purpose buried somewhere beneath all this ear-splitting commotion (this could be re-titled ""Finding Neo"").  The sad fact, though, is that, once we arrive at the climactic scene to which all three films have been building, the resolution turns out to be a ham-handed muddle, utterly lacking in clarity and coherence  After an almost six-hour-long buildup over the course of the three films, the audience is left scratching its collective head wondering just what it was that happened before the closing credits started rolling by.  Perhaps smarter people than I can figure all this out for, frankly, after the overall disappointment occasioned by this film, I couldn't muster either the desire or the effort to probe very deeply into the matter.It goes without saying that the special effects in this film are spectacular - we would expect nothing less - but what we don't get from ""Revolutions"" - which we did from the two previous ""Matrix"" films - is that little something extra in the form of intelligence and sophistication that made them more than just the bland, over-produced, assembly-line products they easily could have become - and which ""Revolutions"" very nearly is.  Even the stolid earnestness of Keanu Reeves can't convince us this time around that there is anything hidden under all those cool gadgets and explosions worth our looking into.Thus endeth the Matrix series, not with a bang but with a whimper - intellectually speaking that is.",N/A
1034176,"Pitched as `the movie the oil companies don't want you to see' but instead proving to be the movie nobody wanted to see, The Formula is a classic example of how blockbuster novels so often turn into mundane films. It has a solid cast, a solid script, solid production values - everything, in fact, but a reason to watch it. It's one of those lethargic thrillers where cardboard characters constantly talk to each other about things that happened offscreen and which the film would have been far better showing us as George C. Scott's LA cop uncovers a conspiracy involving a Nazi formula for synthetic fuel that Marlon Brando's eccentric oilman wants kept under lock and key so he can artificially inflate the price of oil. The teaming of Oscar's two most famous refusniks sadly provides no sparks - indeed, there was reportedly more drama offscreen at the time between director John G. Avildsen and writer/producer Steve Shagan over the re-editing of the film, so it's a genuine surprise to find them jovially sharing the audio commentary on Warners' new DVD. Not that it seems that anyone else was so passionate about the film: there's no shortage of class talent here (John Gielgud and Beatrice Straight also turn up), but it's clear that the paycheck is of more interest to them than the script and they're just slumming it. Not a terrible movie, just a rather flat, uneventful and predictable one.Warners' widescreen 1.85:1 DVD transfer is adequate, but not up to their usual standards, with the mono soundtrack particularly flat.

851440,"Antoine Fuqua's ""King Arthur"" manages to suck all of the magic, valor, and mystery out of the much-loved Arthurian legends.  What is left is a dull, dreary, generic action flick in which King Arthur's noble Knights of the Round Table curse, drink, crack crude jokes, and sex-it up.  Being that ""King Arthur"" has touted itself as ""the untold true story that inspired the legend"", I was left with the impression that King Arthur's knights were crude, dirty bums that sat around all day; drinking and complaining.  Merlin makes an appearance too as part of a face-painted tribe of barbarians living in the woods.  Can you feel the magic here, folks?This ""true story"" is bogged down with stilted speeches about how every man is born free and equal and frantic, confusing battle sequences.  And the script?  Here's a sampling of some of the cinematic masterpieces that await you:Lancelot: There is a large number of lonely men out there.Guinevere: Don't worry; I won't let them rape you.Arthur: O merciful God, I have such need of Your mercy now...Lancelot: Why do you always talk to God and not to me?Gawain: The gifts the gods gave me I use in battle or in bed.Galahad: Imagine what a lovely, quiet place the world would be if everyone had their throats slit.Horton: God help us. What are they?Bors: Blue demons that eat Christians alive. You're not a Christian, are you?The acting just don't cut it either.  From previous experience, I realized that Clive Owen's King Arthur and Keira Knightley's Guinevere (who is now a painted pagan prison inhabitant) are supposed to be falling in love, but it is never apparent to the audience until they, predictably, jump in bed together.  And the famous love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lacelot?  Practically nonexistent.",King Arthur
735034,"I was optimistic for Greg Kinnear once.  He was very funny ragging on Soap Soup.  He usually plays the nice-guy second banana in film or a man dying of AIDS.  Auto Focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960's TV icon, Hogan, in Hogan's Heroes.  The replication of the original cast is a bit eerie.  After all, these actors dress up as German prison guards.  A chill goes down my spine, but Hogan's was a comedy, which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny SS guys.  Anyhow, Bob Crane played Hogan for six years and Kinnear badly imitated.  Yes, I'm sorry to say, Kinnear is awful as Crane, which puts a damper on the bio-flick.Here's a disc jockey with semi-hip 60's patter on the air with an All American family, a loving wife and cute kids.  They live like Ozzie and Harriet in the LA burbs, going to Catholic Church on Sunday.  Crane lands his big break, falling for the trappings of fame.  Most people fall for the trappings of fame.  Read the supermarket check out magazine racks.  So all of a sudden, Crane's garage porn collection isn't enough.  Women, very beautiful, Hollywood loose-morals women find Crane and his buddy William Defoe irresistible.

24267,"Olivier and Leigh. The husband and wife team of the 40s. Preceded by Fairbanks and Pickford, contemporary with Gable and Lombard and followed by Taylor and Burton.""Fire Over England"" was the first pairing of Laurence Olivier (1907-1989) and his future wife Vivien Leigh (1913-67). They met in 1935 and began their affair during this film. They made several films together, including ""That Hamilton Woman"" (1941), and toured together many times in performances of ""Anthony and Cleopatra"",  ""MacBeth"", ""Twelfth Night"", and ""The School for Scandal"". They divorced in 1960.Leigh is best known for her stunning performances in ""GWTW"" (1939) as Scarlett O'Hara and as Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) - she won the Oscar both times. Eventually physical problems, a miscarriage, and the difficulty of living with Olivier would take their toll and she began a slow descent into madness, perhaps precipitated by the 326 performances as DuBois on stage in London followed by  months filming the movie. Between 1955 and 1965 she made only 1 film, but she carried on with her theatre work and even won a Tony in 1963. Her  last film appearance was in 1965 (""Ship of Fools"").Olivier was nominated for an Oscar 10 times, from 1939 (""Wuthering Heights"") to 1978 (""Boys from Brazil""), and won in 1949 for ""Hamlet"". He appeared in 80+ films, usually as an Englishman or in films based in England.  His prime period had been in the 40s, and he made few films in the 50s, probably because of all the personal problems he was having. He appears as #14 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends.Flora Robson (1902-84) appeared in more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Saratoga Trunk"" (1945). She played Elizabeth in this film and reprised her role for ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), another Alexander Korda film. Many people believe that she is the definitive Elizabeth, although my preference would be Bette Davis in ""Essex and Elizabeth"" (1939). Other actresses who've played Elizabeth include Glenda Jackson (1971), Helen Mirren (2005), Sarah Bernhardt (1912) and Cate Blanchett (1998, 2007). Actresses who played Elizabeth twice include Robson, Bette Davis (1938, 1955) and Cate Blanchett (1998, 2007).BTW - Robson was only 35 when she appeared in this film. By comparison, Bette Davis was 30 when she first played her and Cate Blancehtt was 29. The film depicts Elizabeth in her mid 50s.Raymond Massey (1896-1983) plays King Philip of Spain. He is best remembered for his roles as Lincoln. He was nominated for an Oscar for playing ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940) which remains, to date, the best ever portrayal of Lincoln. He reprised the role on TV in ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" (1950) and again in ""How the West Was Won"" (1962). On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series ""Dr Kildare"" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films. I remember him best for his over the top portrayal of John Brown in ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940). Prior to playing Lincoln, most of his roles were villainous (e.g., Citizen Chauvelin in ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", Black Michael in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"", Prince Ghul in ""The Drum"").The great Robert Newton (1905-56) plays Don Pedro. This was his third of what was to become more than 50 films that included ""Henry V"", ""Oliver Twist"" (1948), ""Les Miserables"" (1952) and my personal favorite, ""Treasure Island"" (1950).James Mason has a tiny role in the beginning of the film. When it was re-released in 1944 and Mason had become a star, Korda commissioned a new trailer that stressed Mason's part.Alexander Korda (1893-1956) produced nearly 60 films in his career that started in 1923 in Hungary. His break through film was ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) and there followed a series of historical dramas including ""Rise of Catherine the Great"" (1934), ""Private Life of Don Juan"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934) and ""Rembrandt"" (1936), of which ""Fire Over England"" is a lesser example. Korda was known for his cheap production values, which are evident in this film.The film was produced in 1937. It has some suggestions that involvement on the continent is dangerous, as later events would prove.This is a fairly standard historical drama of the 30s and mostly forgettable. It is notable as being the film that David Selznick saw which convinced him that Vivien Leigh could play Scarlett. Far better films from this period about the Elizabethan era include ""Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939) and ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940).",N/A
1021096,"The most blatant flaw with this production was the casting:  The handsome Toby Stephens (like the gorgeous Timothy Dalton in the earlier BBC production) is totally inappropriate because Bronte depicts Rochester as an ugly, Vulcan-like man of medium height.  (Also, Stephens' acting (he's not convincing as a man who has lived in empty misery for 15 years) is mediocre, so he's not credible on that score, either.)  In the novel Jane is a small woman with irregular features.  Ruth Wilson is a tall beauty.  One of the things Rochester and Jane understand about one another is how it feels to be considered ugly relative to the population at large.  As a couple, Wilson and Stephens would easily fit in at a Hollywood party.  Clearly the idolatry of the modern age influenced the director, who, given the BBC's reputation for quality television should have known better.  The cynical view is that Stephens' status as the son of renowned British actress Dame Maggie Smith influenced his casting.A lot of time was spent highlighting the romance scenes between Rochester and Jane, Celine and Rochester, St. John and Miss Oliver, and even Bertha and Rochester. I believe this was done to attract young women viewers who will love these scenes -- and buy the DVD.  We don't, however, see much of (1) Bronte's criticism of the Church (i.e., St. John's coldness of heart, and its inconsistency with Jesus' character, or Mr. Brocklehurst's cruelty), or (2) the persistence of good in an evil environment (as displayed in Bessie, Ms. Temple, Helen Burns), both major themes in the novel.  Clearly, commercial appeal won out over artistic quality and the author's intent.Though the production is not embarrassing (notwithstanding the acting of several characters is not of the caliber one expects in a BBC production), it is disappointing in its blatant refusal to honor the key features of the novel (i.e., ugly people can find love, too; hypocrisy and cruelty in the Church of England; child abuse; Christian duty to do right when life has been hard).  (Again, these themes won't sell DVDs.) The Sorcha Cusack/Michael Jayston production (1973) is the most faithful to the novel and an absolute delight to watch.

536214,"Upon initial viewing, I found this film equal parts entertaining and gratuitous (and quite over the top); despite the expert, near-camp direction of Ridley Scott and the honorable performance of Julianne Moore in a daring reimagining of Jodie Foster's triumphant role, its net effect was to somewhat sour my memory of Silence of the Lambs.  However, I was not particularly resentful of its existence until I bought the DVD.I'm a great fan of DVD documentaries and featurettes; I've always appreciated being given insights into the genesis and construction of films, even those detailing the production of movies I didn't particularly enjoy.  Unfortunately, after watching the ""Making of Hannibal"" piece on this DVD, I developed a true hatred of ""Hannibal"", and by association the entire Lecter franchise.The reason?  One Martha De Laurentiis (nee Schumacher), the widow of the late Dino De Laurentiis and producer of the Hannibal series from this film onward.  She is the salient narrator of this ghastly ""making of"" documentary, and watching her is like being powdered with fleas for 45 minutes.Mrs. De Laurentiis (and I use this salutation over Ms., as her marriage appears to be the most auspicious item on her CV), was previously a producer of relentless D-grade schlock films based on bargain-basement Stephen King adaptations (Maximum Overdrive, Cats Eye, Firestarter) before meeting and marrying Dino De Laurentiis, a Hollywood legend responsible for producing an even longer list of exploitation films and sequels.  The pasha's riches Mrs. De Laurentiis subsequently inherited from this unholy union (to a man nearly 40 years her senior) apparently included his vast fortune, a nepotistic position as president of his production company, and a very painful faux Italian accent.For the length of this documentary, this woman, who save her Donatella hairdo looks as if she plopped off the Mayflower, gushes one ""che bellisimo"" after another about how ""delicious"" it is to see Anthony Hopkins reprising his role as Hannibal the Cannibal, all  the while trilling her R's to the accompaniment of operatic choral music and spaghetti, linguini, blah blah blah.  As an Italian myself, after 10 minutes of cheesy That's Amore and inserts of sacred Florencian statues I had the urge to rush out for a nose-job and a new birth certificate.  The original film skittered enough on the precipice of artifice, but Mrs. De Laurentiis ladles so much garlicky pretentiousness and ostentation on the production that one is left more bloated and gassy than after a meal at Olive Garden.It is now impossible for me to watch this film (and its successors) without flashbacks to this looney hack's glee over the vast wealth she has amassed exploiting and embellishing the virtues of the original Silence of the Lambs.  I had to retrieve my jaw off the floor after listening to her glibly toss off Jodie Foster's sage decision to forgo reprising her role as Clarice Starling as ""disappointing, but totally solvable"", as if swapping actors known for beloved performances was as facile as choosing Buitoni over De Cecco.  She carries herself as if she had invented the primitive zoetrope, as opposed to have simply married someone old enough to have actually done it.This shameless PR piece is layered with a soaring, exultant score of endless arias and cellists reaching below their knees on their fretboards, apparently to imbue it with class (ala the tenors who serenade you at Macaroni Grill). And with the panoramic vistas of Florence, and handheld shots of the posh premiere (including a gorgeous spread of antipasti and Christopher Walken looking like a mafioso), one is led to believe that Hannibal is actually some De Sica masterpiece, rather than the gory, expensive splatter film it is.  How did I overlook the absurdity of Ray Liotta being fed his frontal lobes whilst Gourmet Valse Tartare was blasting on the soundtrack?Mangia, indeed.",N/A
409685,"Had to see what the hubbub was about with Romero's original ""classics."" So, I got suckered into seeing this steaming pile. I'm giving it two stars pretty much on Romero's name alone, as an innovator in the zombie genre. NOT because it's high cinema, which I really DON'T think it is.To be frank, the movie seems anachronistic and rather tame by today's standards. Sure it was made in the 70's and for the time it was considered to be pushing the envelope. Today, well, it just doesn't hold up against modern zombie movies.I mean, the zombies are just people in blue makeup. Terrifying, I know! (Not so much...) They shamble... Slowly. Like you could get away from them with a brisk walk! (Horrifying!) There was no tension. There was no foreboding terror. Not even a little good-natured shiver going down my spine. Really it was a few hours of boredom. I think at one point I even checked how much longer the movie had left to run (about 1/2 an hour), that how bored I was. I was waiting all movie for some serious zombie munching and was disappointed at its overall absence outside of the last 1/2 hour (and even that was fairly tame and movie-esque, in my opinion; though perhaps forgivable given the era of cinema it was released in).I kept wanting the people to stop being dumb arses and go on a zombie killing spree. I mean, the zombies are slow. They have NO evasion skills. They have no ""strategery"" skills (yes, I know, I mean strategy, geez!). The humans have access to a gun store and about all the ammo they can possibly use. The reason they couldn't simply walk around methodically (and briskly!) decapitating zombies or blasting them in the skull with shot guns was WHAT now? I mean, if your first thought is survival isn't the object to eliminate the walking dead so they don't sneak up on you while you're using the can? But no, they just let the zombies go about their business for the first third of the movie.This movie didn't frighten me. It didn't disturb me (unlike 28 Days Later, which was rather disturbing insofar as the ""infected"" kept vomiting blood and stuff all over the place). There was maybe one scene of a guy getting ripped apart for being a dumb arse and sticking his arm into a blood pressure monitoring machine's arm strap in the middle of an ongoing zombie invasion. Frankly he deserved what he got and I had zero sympathy for him. That and he was part of a roving band of marauders, so I had double the zero sympathy for him (what's two times zero?)...Yeah, it may have been considered pioneering at the time, but today it's just a piece of tame, anachronistic tripe. If you want something a considerably less tame try theRemakeor theResident Evil TrilogyorSlitherorPlanet Terror.Sure, the classics are ""classic."" They're the genre's ""origins.""

For me, as for any lawyer who watches his performances, his blatant disregard of the rights of the accused under the U.S. Constitution is just too, too ludicrous.  Even the most novice of rookie detectives knows that you can not, without a warrant, go into someone's house or apartment and pick up objects and photographs at will.  And it is not as if the people being investigated by D'Onofrio and Erbe (whose disregard of proper procedure is just a bit less outrageous than that of her partner) are from Papua New Guinea;  they are often doctors, educators, and others who presumably would throw the pair out of the place unless they had a warrant.  Just watch a few of the episodes with Chris Noth and Julianne Nicholson playing the D'Onofrio and Erbe parts to see how good this version of Law and Order can be.",N/A
1469594,"Sick & Stupid Score: 2/7*This is an amateur movie, especially because of its stilted dialog, clueless acting, and uncreative plot.Bruce Willis is on screen for the first 20 minutes and then disappears, something we have noticed in several so-called Bruce Willis movies lately.  It seems he is just selling his name to the movie producers.  Ditto for Sigourney Weaver, although she does hang around until the end of the show, she pops in and out as needed, trying to look and act convincing as a stone-cold spy mistress.  She gives a ridiculous performance.Otherwise, no-talent actors, uninteresting plot, and a couple obligatory car chases, probably filmed only for the purpose of making the trailer.  Made on the cheap in Spain.________________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.",N/A

650306,"I didn't think it was possible for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" to be worse than the last pirates movie, ""Dead Man's Chest."" I was wrong.I can't understand why the second and third installments of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films are so craptastic when the first movie was so amazing. ""At World's End"" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. As with ""Dead Man's Chest,"" the problem rests entirely with the script. I will not even attempt to describe the plot of this movie because it's so ridiculous and awful. The third movie is the worst of the series because the basic plot is stupid, there are 25,000 dumb things going on at once, and most of the dialogue is lousy and provides little comic relief. Among the asinine aspects of ""At World's End"" are the schizophrenic Jack Sparrows, the ""Attack of Johnny Depp's Nose""/crab walk scene, Calypso the 100-foot-tall giantess, and what happens to Will Turner at the end of the movie. (Is this seriously supposed to be a happy ending for Will and Elizabeth?! My cat could have penned a better script!)There are a few redeeming qualities about the film, and there's room for me to list them all here because they are so few and far between:+ Geoffrey Rush is back as Captain Barbossa. If he wasn't in this movie (which is almost three hours long, by the way: it was excruciating to sit through), I couldn't have made it to the end. I seriously would have walked out of the theatre after less than an hour.+ The special effects are fantastic.+ We get to see Johnny Depp without his shirt on. (It's only for a fraction of a second and he was looking rather pasty, but still...it was definitely a highlight of the film.)+ We also get to see Bill Nighy's face without the crazy Squid Man ensemble. That glimpse only lasts for a brief moment, but I welcomed any break from Squid Man.+ Keith Richards has a brief cameo as Jack's father. He's absolutely hysterical in the film. (Sadly, I think there were only a handful of people in the theatre who knew who Keith Richards IS. It's so sad.)To say that I was disappointed with this movie would be an understatement. It's a terrible, terrible film. I wish the ""Pirates"" sequels had never been made, or that I'd been asked to write the screenplays instead, because I can guarantee that I'd crank out better material than this garbage.Let's just hope that there isn't a ""Pirates 4!""",N/A

913730,"I would give it 2.5, but I rounded down to two because of all the fives on Amazon.  I read the reviews and was excited after seeing some parts on youtube, but I was left disappointed.  I normally watch films like these with subtitles, but my wife doesn't like that so I used the English dubbing, but I doubt that had anything to do with the atrocious music.I am a big martial arts fan.  I must have watched ""Enter the Dragon"" 100 times as a kid and loved Bruce Lee's other movies.  Later ""Rumble in the Bronx"" renewed my zeal and I eagerly watched Chan's other films, the old and new ""Iron Monkey"" movies, ""Wing Chun"", ""Tai Chi Master"", the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series and many more.  I saw this film and was excited by all the rave reviews.  This movie doesn't use wire work like many of Jet Li's films and I was expecting something akin to the excellent ""Chocolate"", but this movie has several flaws.Before going through the flaws, I would like to say that the fight scenes are pretty exciting.  It was nice to see the Muai Thai fighting style which I was unfamiliar with.First, the plot is poor.  The ""quest"" is for a poor country martial artist to travel to the big city and recover the head of a statue that the village worships.  Apparently they need it back to end the drought that is plaguing their village, but the drought must have started while the statue was whole because he seems to leave almost immediately after the head is stolen.Second, the music is poor.  It is bad enough that I wish I could have turned on subtitles and turned the volume on my TV off.  I've never heard a score this bad in a movie before.Third, the movie frequently stops for two replays whenever Jaa does some interesting move (such as jump over some spikes or do the splits sliding under a truck).  Seeing the same move (which frankly didn't seem that impressive) three times took me out of the movie and ruined the flow of the action.  Switching to slow motion from a different angle would have been much better. Jaa performs several acrobatic feats in one chase scene through alleys and streets, but his pursuers keep up with him, I wonder if that is because he was doing those things three times :).Fourth, several things are just weird.  [some minor spoilers] One instance is that Jaa is basically forced to fight when he steps out in the open towards the clerk that takes bets while the announcer is asking for challengers, yet he is surprised.  Then he gets the clerk to give back the villager's money that his cousin had stolen and bet, but refuses the prize money for winning the fight.  What clerk would just give the money to someone that hadn't bet it when it had been lost?  Another thing is the part that guns play in the movie.  There's one scene near the end when a few people have guns and it is fairly realistic when they avoid being shot.  But later a big fight plays out and the big bad guy only pulls out a gun at the end to shoot him, why didn't the others in there have guns and why did nobody use them earlier?  Another time the bad guy goes through a lengthy speech and tells them that he is now their god and they should obey him.  Then he leaves with instructions to ""kill them quietly"".  It just seemed like he was going to keep them around and use them somehow, but I guess not.  This one might be due to dubbing.  I still don't get why he didn't go to the address he had for the guy that took the head, either immediately when he got to the city or when he was separated from his cousin a few times.  I wonder what he was doing then...Lastly, except for Jaa, the acting is pretty bad.How anyone can give this movie five stars is beyond me.  It has severe deficiencies in directing, acting, plot, score and editing.  Don't take my word for it, buy it yourself and then post an honest review.  I was sorry to have made my wife stay up late and watch it with me, and glad when she went to bed 2/3 the way through.",Ong-Bak - The Thai Warrior
878602,"Desperate Housewives was a fun little show in the beginning, but as the season went on, the comedy lacked and got repetative.  How many times can Susan fall on her face?  How many times can Lynette yell at her kids? How many times can Bree clean? How many times can Edie flirt? How many times can Gabrielle complain about money?  It got very dull.Also, every plot twist that they threw at us was very predictable.  Half the things they told us at the end of the season were things I predicted in the very first episode.  Also, the mystery throughout the season got very over dramatic.  It was too dramatic to be a dramedy (drama-comedy).  Plus, the answers that were given were very disappointing.  It wasn't worth watching the whole season.  Plus, there was no cliffhanger.What bugs me even more than the lack of entertainment that this show has to offer is how big a deal people make about Terri Hatcher.  She isn't very good compared to the other women.  I think that Felicity Huffman is phenominal along with Eva and Marcia.I would leave this one to the rental stores.

198608,"Lon Chaney was booked to star in the title role of this film, but unfortunately died just prior to shooting. Bela Lugosi, who had starred in the stage production of Dracula was brought in right before shooting started. The movie suffers for this. Lugosi does not have time to learn how to act for the camera. I don't know what kind of plans director Todd Browning had for the Chaney version, but the final Lugosi version looks like a mere filming of the stage play. Set up the camera in front of the proscenium, and flip it on, and then leave it on autopilot. There is no innovation, and no significant script changes made to take advantage of the film medium.This film is still worth seeing, just don't go in with the high expectations this film's reputation may lead you to have. If you are expecting to be overwhelmed by the drama, you will be disappointed. If you are expecting to be scared out of your skin, you will be disappointed.

1525406,"""The Darkest Hour"" has potential. The premise is pretty darn interesting (although it's borrowed from other science fiction novels that have been around for at least twenty plus years)--what if an alien invasion occurs by creatures that we just can't see and appear to be electrical in nature? How do we fight something like that much less survive?When a website designer Ben(Anthony Mingella) and his best friend Sean(Emile Hirsch)travel to Moscow to pitch their new design to a company they are greeted with disappointed--the head of the company Skyler (Joel Kinnaman)has ripped off the design and has no plans on paying them (his advice--""next time include a PDA""). The angry and disappointed duo end up clubbing where they meet Natalie (Olivia Tirlby)and Anne (Rachal Taylor). The attack occurs while the four and Skyler are at the club. Everyone who comes into contact with the aliens are vaporized and the quintet are on the run for their survival.There's all the best elements for a thriller here but the writers (including Jon Spaihts who worked on an early version of ""Prometheus"")and director Chris Gorak (who directed a fascinating Indie thrillerRight at Your Doorwhere he does everything right that he gets wrong in this movie)do very little to develop the characters or the premise beyond your standard invasion movie. In fact ""The Darkest Hour"" borrows liberally from other recent invasion flicks (including Spielberg's version of War of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition)).The Blu-ray release of this looks extremely good. Shot on digital video it almost looks as good as film in terms of its presentation here.The 5.2 lossless soundtrack sounds terrific with strong presence but still maintaining clear dialogue.The special features are actually in some ways better than the feature film itself. ""Survivors"" a short film based in the same ""world"" manages to be a stronger examination of the same themes.""Visualizing the Invasion"" gives us the behind-the-scenes nuts and bolts of creating the interesting visual effects used throughout the film.We also get deleted and extended scenes with commentary that gives us a bit of context as to why they were not used.Finally we get a feature length commentary track by the director focusing on everything the challenges of shooting for a 3D exhibition (knowing eventually it will be shown without the 3D effects as well), shooting on location in Moscow and the various changes that were made to the script prior to shooting.It's a pity that the director and writers didn't take a more unusual approach to the material as the premise itself it fascinating but it is developed into a VERY conventional invasion thriller with few surprises in the film.""The Darkest Hour"" might be worth a rental (which is what I did)but I really couldn't recommend purchasing it unless you temper your expectations and get it for a decent price.",N/A

202182,"This film may have been originally intended as ""left-wing propaganda,"" as some reviewers contend...or not. It may just be Costa-Gavras's simplistic worldview that is not necessarilly left or right wing but definitely victim-centric.It's essentially another example of being dumb enough to get into something WAY over your head and not surviving to tell about it.Charles/Charlie Hormann (Charles to his dad, Charlie to his wife) lives, writes and snoops around in a South American country (Chile, maybe! wink wink) that is imploding with civil war--a military regime has just overthrown the kind, compassionate Marxists who were most recently in power. Charlie, when not working on his illustrated fable starring a duck (yes, he's sensitive and artistic), takes a little road trip and runs into a guy who may as well be wearing a t-shirt that says, I AM A CIA ASSASSIN. (""Here's my card, in case you want someone whacked."") Charlie pesters this person with questions of a political nature, clumsily trying to get information about the coup but instead marking himself as a troublemaker.Because the CIA usually knows what it's doing, Charlie then disappears. COULD IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS STUPIDITY? As it happens, yes.His dad flies down, and this is really the best aspect of the film: Jack Lemmon is great. Mr. Hormann at first gives the American government--represented by embassy personnel--the benefit of the doubt when they, Sergeant Schulz-like, claim to know NOTHING. But it eventually becomes obvious that they're just trying to be nice and cooperative until Mr. Hormann goes back home--which only makes Hormann more determined. (His daughter-in-law/Charlie's wife, Sissy Spacek, treats the authorities with cynicism and hostility,and Hormann eventually begins to see that she has her reasons.) Eventually Mr. Hormann has to admit to himself that his country's representatives may be up to no good, and that Charlie was indeed the victim of foul play.Your heart really goes out to Lemmon when he tells the ambassador, ""I just want my boy back.""But sympathy for Charlie? I didn't have much. This is the equivalent of a person who wants to go swimming in shark-infested waters, even though everyone around him warns him not to, and he just INSISTS, and then of course gets eaten...okay, is the shark the bad guy here?Thousands of young people disappeared in Chile when the movie takes place, and yes, American hands were bloodied in that upheaval. At the same time, there were sound reasons to try to contain Marxism in this hemisphere.  The ends don't justify the means, but this is the way Chileans played the game on their own turf, so I don't know how much input or control our guys actually had.Charlie learned the hard way that you don't poke a stick into a hornets' nest.

Following a hunch he goes to an old snitches' apartment where there is a ""party"" taking place.There he meets Natasha(Olga Kunylenko)who takes a liking to him.Her sister is Mona Sax(Mila Kunis) and she is there with her gang;Russians of whom she is the leader.Mona tries to stop her sister from carrying on but is assuaged by Natasha who leaves with Max.Max takes her back to his apartment but she leaves shortly thereafter when he spurns her advances.On the way back home she is killed.The next day Max's ex partner takes him to the crime scene and reveals his wallet was found near the body.Max explains that she stole it but circumstances don't look good.They part on bad terms but later his old partner phones him with information that might be the key to the mystery of his wifes' death.Max finds him dead at his home,where a struggle ensues and Max blacks out.He wakes up to find an old friend of his father,BB Hensley(Beau Bridges),by his bedside in the hospital.BB is now head of security of the Aesir Corporation;the same company his wife worked for.Max continues his quest and finds some of the evidence his ex partner left behind and it is the tattoos of wings that are on the murder victims which correspond to the wings logo on all Aesir documents.BB fears for Max but can do nothing to stop him.He next interrogates an Aesir employee who finally spills the beans on what happened to his late wife and baby.As he escorts him out his office the witness is killed and Max barely escapes with his life.He takes the evidence to Natasha's sister Mona.It seems the Aesir Corp.has been illegally manufacturing and selling a drug called Valkyr(val-keer)that comes in a small vile.It had been originally designed for military troops but the drugs' terrible side effects forced the company to(officially)withdraw it from production. The company has been using an ex marine,Sgt Jack Lupino,as their pusher,but he has gotten way out of control.Mona tells Max where he can find Lupino which takes him to a local club called Ragnarock.When Max finally confronts Lupino BB ""happens ""upon the scene and saves his life by killing Lupino.We next find Max and BB down by the harbour which BB intends to throw him into with viles of Valkyr on him to make it look like a drug killing.After a short struggle Max gets free but his only option is to jump into the icy cold harbour.This  is where we came in.Max barely makes it out alive and the only thing that saves him from hypothermia are the viles of Valkyr he ingests.He heads straight for the Aesir tower to get BB and ends up cornering him on the roof helio-pad.There he shoots BB dead and the movie ends as the sun comes up on another day.There are many direct and indirect references in the film to the game such as the subway station called Roscoe Street,which the film gets to a ways in.This is where the game itself pretty much starts as Max tells us(in the game)""Death was in the air at Roscoe Street"".Then there is the look of the film which matches the game quite well;the constant snow falling.The Aesir Corp.,is pronounced ""Acer"" in the game but starngely two ways in the film,""Acer"" and ""A-seer"".The final line from the film matches that of the game:""I don't know about heaven,but I believe in angels"".However many of the characters names,ethnicities and importance in plot have been changed around,sometimes more than others.The game sees Max go from one clue to the next which leads to the final battle at Aesir plaza and the taking down of the person responsible for it all;the president of the company a Ms Horne,as he blows up her helicopter as she flees.In the film Ms Horne is more of a shadowy figure who just pulls the strings with the ultimate fight going between Max and his old fathers friend BB;with the helio-pad as just a point of reference.The Russians in the game have far more of a presence but are not headed by Mona.Mona in the game is just a colleague of Max's.Throughout the film we are given the impression that the cops suspect Max himself but they never fire on him.In the game Max is pursued and shot at not only by the bad guys but the NYPD all the way through to the end.Lastly while Jim Bravura in the game is a white stereotypical NYPD cop who appears on TV newcasts and is constantly dogging the heels of Max,in the film they have turned him black and he is now just an ineffectual internal investigator played like a piece of cardboard by rapper Ludicris.The characters and action are all shallow and cartoonish such as when Max gets shot twice and both times there is no further reference to them and he just keeps going.Or when Max,for some reason,heads down an alley and ends up at the end of it walking backwards and getting a gun pointed at his head from around a corner.It is such a bone head move one wishes one had game control of him,because YOU wouldn't have made such a stupid and obvious error.By the way the person who ""surprises"" him is Mona,Nathasha's sister.While in the Aesir building Mona comes out of nowhere to appear and saves Max's life;no rhyme nor reason except to keep Max alive until the end of the picture.I'm usually terrible at figuring out who did it ahead of time but it is not far into the film and you just KNOW that BB is the one behind all the goings on;it is just too obvious.The DVD technically is presented in its original widescreen ratio of 2:35:1 and has been transferred well.Special features are limited with just director and production designer commentary with the trailers;and neither are close captioned.The DVD does include the theatrical and unrated versions but believe me there is a little difference between the two versions that would make one better over the other.I always hope that the film versions of video games will at least try and aspire to come up to a modicum of the games original intents,feel and excitement.While many have,this one doesn't.It is great to see Beau Bridges once again as one doesn't see enough of this good actor,but he got caught in a poke this time which is unfortunate.The film is just too flimsy and shallow for anyone to rise above its' mundane foundation.I would never pay full price for this DVD nor even $5 at the bargain bin at Wal-Mart,it is so poor.I would advise you to pick up the original video game(available on many platforms)and play it yourself for a much more intense,enjoyable and satisfying experience and give THIS Max Payne a pass or you will find yourself having your own Payne-ful experience!",N/A
454682,"This review is not regarding the actual film itself, but rather the poor quality of this DVD release.The transfer used on this ""25th Anniversary Edition"" DVD is of VHS quality. The colors are extremely dull and washed out, and it's clear that the print did not come from a film source.This is quite surprising considering the transfer used on the Trimark DVD released way back in 1998 did come from a good looking film print! That is still the version to get if you're seeking the best looking transfer available on DVD.The 5.1 audio mix used is also quite generic. It has no extra depth over the original 2.0 mix, and even sounds ""tinny"" in a fake sort of way.They've also shoved all of the bonus material onto a single-layer disc, and thus compression artifacts are often very noticeable.The bonus features on the disc are interesting, but nothing to scream home about. And you can find all of these features on the previous ""Collector's Edition"" that this same DVD studio released in 2005.",The Shadow Riders
960450,"***Warning: this review may contain spoilers ***At the beginning of 'History of Violence', we meet two vicious killers who murder three people in a motel including a young child. Director Cronenberg immediately cuts to his protagonists, the Stall family, so I thought this was going to end up as another 'Desperate Hours', home invasion type of flick, with the bad guys invading the family home and perhaps terrorizing them or taking somebody hostage. Refreshingly, for a few moments at least, Cronenberg goes in another direction. The bad guys are dispatched by the principal protagonist, Tom Stall, played by Viggo Mortensen. It turns out that Stall has tried to erase his past life as Joey Cusack, a Mafia hoodlum, and has assumed a new identity in an idyllic Indiana town. But at the critical moment, while working at his place of business, a family diner, he's able to use his past skills as a made man and blows away the killers. As a result, he becomes an instant celebrity and becomes the subject of media scrutiny.Unfortunately, beyond this point, not a lot makes sense in this film. For starters, Cronenberg admits that the media scrutiny is only a local phenomena. The truth of the matter is that such a story would not remain a local event but would be covered nationally as well as on the internet. After Mafia boss Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) shows up on the scene, folksy Sheriff Sam Carney does some 'research' to try and find out whether Fogarty is telling the truth that Tom has been leading a double life. For some reason, he's only able to find out about Mafia boss 'Ritchie'--there's no mention of Joey anywhere. Now why is that? A Google search would have certainly brought up information on the brother of a well known mobster such as Joey who police are aware ripped Fogarty's eye out. Furthermore, once the media found out about Tom the hero, there would have been intense scrutiny about his background leading to the discovery that Tom is not who he says he is.Now what about the ridiculous scene where Tom ends up seeing Fogarty's car and assumes it's heading out of town to his house to do harm to his family? Why does he start running all the way home? If he believed that the mobsters were going to hurt his family, wouldn't he have 1) called Sheriff Sam immediately and 2) grabbed a car or got one of his employees or friends to drive him home right away? Why do the mobsters attempt to induce Tom to come with them? He's standing right out on the lawn when Fogarty or one of his two henchmen could have went right up to him and shot him in the head? For that matter, if they wanted to, they could have killed the whole family right then and there.What exactly happened to Fogarty and his henchmen after Tom and Jack blow them away? We never see the police arrive and the bodies being taken away. Wouldn't there have been even more media interest which certainly would have led to the discovery that Tom was connected to the mobsters in the past? All we see is the Sheriff come over and make some meek inquiries as to Tom's background.While we find out next to nothing about Ed Harris's Fogarty, the same goes for brother Ritchie. They are both stereotypes of the typical Mafiosi. Cronenberg resorts to making Ritchie into a buffoon and admits that he didn't use a soundtrack during the climactic scene where Tom dispatches his brother and his minions in order to play up the comedy. Another stereotype is the school bully who is constantly harassing son Jack. How many times have we seen this type of character in poorly written films? Even worse, the bullying isn't even convincing (would a bully pick a fight just because a guy catches a baseball and the game is over?) In order to 'humanize' his principals, Tom and Edie, Cronenberg pads his film with overlong sex scenes. Worse is his obsession with showing all the blood and guts that are spilled whenever someone is shot. There's even an absurd 'DVD extra' which shows contrasting American and International versions of a scene focusing on the amount of blood that spurts out of a victim's mouth.While technically Cronenberg is a highly competent director who is able to get decent performances out of his actors, the script he's working with is amateurish. Ironically, History of Violence has little 'history' in it at all. Instead, it's a sordid tale of redemption in which a reformed man must defend himself against one-dimensional straw men who we neither care or know next to nothing about.",N/A

317713,"A sad ending to Roger Moore's mostly distinquished career as the World's Greatest Spy. Pointless and void of any real drama,&quot;View to a Kill&quot; joins &quot;Moonraker&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; in the dubious category of all-time 007 stinkers. Moore should've called it quits after &quot;Octopussy&quot;, his highly enjoyable romp from 1983. To blame the aging Moore for &quot;View's&quot; many pratfalls, however, is missing the point. The plot to destroy Silicon Valley with an earthquake seems implausible. The usually creepy Christopher Walken scares absolutely no one as arch-villain Max Zorin. Walken and Grace Jones (May Day) commit the ultimate sin of Bond villainy --- they're flat out boring. Even worse, however, is Tanya Roberts' inept Bond Girl Stacey Sutton. Her performance is sadly laughable. In fact, if not for Denise Richards in &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot;, Roberts would be sole possessor of the Worst Bond Girl Award. On the bright side the stunts are top-notch, especially the jump from the Eiffel Tower. The fight atop the Golden Gate Bridge is very well staged. However, the fire-truck chase through the streets of San Francisco is ludicrous. It's almost as if the producers, obviously blank on ideas, intentionally chose the most cliched of locations (the overused San Francisco)and decided to appeal to the lowest common demoninator by staging yet another &quot;Bullit&quot;-like race up and down that city's hilly streets. That stuff belongs on an episode of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, not a Bond flick. Ugh! And as a final point of contention, there's the truly awful title song courtesy of Duran Duran.(Of course, it topped the charts! Go figure...)The saving grace of &quot;View&quot; is the DVD package itself. As always, MGM is to be commended for a job well done. Included is the highly informative documentary &quot;Inside View to a Kill&quot;, which I found to be far more interesting than the movie itself. Another worthwhile documentary included with &quot;View&quot; is &quot;The Music of James Bond&quot;. Also of interest are director John Glen's audio commentary and the original theatrical trailers. &quot;View To a Kill&quot; will satisfy only over-zealous Bond fanatics, such as myself, who just have to have all the extra goodies that come with the DVD. Overall, a one star movie presented in a four star package.",N/A
471336,"I LOVED Candyman 1, I LIKED Candyman 2, but Candyman 3 just didn't grab me. The series here goes direct-to-video and it really hurts the film. It just feels and looks cheaper than the first two. The story also isn't all that special. There just isn't anything new to do with Candyman. Tony Todd does a good job as the title role, by Donna De'errico leaves a bad taste in the mouth and makes the film seem really [inferior]. Whenever a baywatch beauty is featured in movie, it just makes the movie seem poor. Candyman fanatics may find some mild interest int he film, but it is passable. I really hope they end the series here. Part 3 is almost too much and a part 4 would push the series over the edge.

1130273,"I've followed both the book and made-for-TV series for quite a while. While I believe the novel Comanche Moon was a pretty decent read, this movie adaptation is the worst of the Lonesome Dove series.Zahn did a decent job as Gus McRae (you can tell he had studied Duvall's  portrayal of the character and tried to get down the technique, and while not perfect, it wasn't bad) - but most of the other actors literally sounded like they were reading right from the script. Urban was really a terrible W.F.Call, and while I thought West Studi was good as Famous Shoes in Streets of Laredo, he didn't seem to fit the role of Buffalo Hump in this one, not at all. Val Kilmer was absolutely awful as Inish Scull. Instead of giving the impression he was a tough, if slightly eccentric Yankee-in-Texas, he came across as a clown.I noticed Halmark/Artisan didn't produce this one as they did the others in the series (which were all better - I'd rank them in this order as the best to least: Lonesome Dove, Streets of Laredo, Dead Man's Walk) and I don't know if that had something to do with it, but this was pretty bad. I'm not even comparing it to Lonesome Dove other than to say Zahn did a decent job of learning Duvall's mannerisms for McRae, but even as a stand alone Western this one just felt cheap and looked cheap. Almost no one seemed to have really gotten into acting their characters and it shows.",Comanche Moon: The Second Chapter in the Lonesome Dove Saga
1248552,"I had hopes for the movie before I found out what it was about.And once it started, it just was an entirely too weak plot to really care about.There were a few good moments, like how the angel used his wings in a fight, but that was really about it.As others said, the core plot point, the baby, seemed almost an afterthought.And let's face it - if there really is a god, and he really wanted to wipe life off the planet, could some people in a truck stop really stop it?  If god really wanted to do this, why wouldn't he just do it?  What would the point be in having powerful angels possess mortal bodies so the mortal bodies could be killed so easily rather than having the angels themselves do the deed in their own form which has proven indestructible to mortal efforts?Too many holes, too many places where, even though it was a fantasy story, common sense was just stretched beyond all endurance.Some big names for such a small movie...",Legion

After all the great action and suspense in the last MI movie and the great reviews I heard and the money it made I just knew this was a sure hit. Even the title is very cool. But what I watched lacked a reasonable plot had zero suspense. The action was not even that great and the bad guy came off as some crazy fool who's ideas made little sense and was not explained at all.The actors were just as poor the girl on the team should have kept her part on Law and Order SVU. I hope they never let her do another MI movie. And I hope the other guy that was an agent does a btter job brining something to the Bourne and Avengers movies he will be in.

Well we saw that car for all of 3 to 4 min and it looked nice but hey what was so cool about it?I do agree with another reviewer that special features on the DVD were also very weak. For me the best MI was number 3 with this being the bottom one. Many die hard MI fans hate the first one for what they did to Mr. Phelps. I am glad the director for the next one will not be the same.

559074,"The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat ""hero"" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed.",N/A

1004742,"By 1974 Amando de Ossario's Blind Dead films seemed to be in a rut. The release of The Ghost Galleon (Horror of the Zombies in America) did nothing to help the series'eventual demise. What started out as a fairly interesting concept had collapsed under its own weight.The Blind Dead Knight's Templar are back but now they exist in another dimension upon a forever floating ghost ship. The plotting is fairly non-existent. Two models are set adrift on a boat in the major shipping channel by sports equipment tycoon Howard Tucker (Jack Taylor) as a publicity stunt to draw attention to his new water craft. The two girls drift into a mysterious fog and see an ancient floating galleon. This galleon promptly crashes into them. One of the models (Margarita Merino, in an uncredited role) boards the ship rather than stay in her own boat. That night screams are heard and she is never seen again. Her model partner Kathy (Blanca Estrada) follows her friend onto the galleon finding that the Blind Dead are on board who rapidly turn her into zombie dinner.Thrown into the mix are a would be rescue squad led by Tucker. The group also includes Nomei (Barbara Rey) with whom Kathy may have been having a lesbian affair, Kathy and Nomei's employer Lillian (Maria Perschy), a seemingly lost Professor, and Sergei, Tucker's henchman bodyguard. What follows is fairly predictable with the zombies killing off each one of the rescuers as the film progresses.The Blue Underground disc features both Spanish and English audio. On this film I opted for the English. The picture quality is very good considering the source material. The viewer should be aware that much of the film is dark and very foggy so clarity is a major issue.The story as I alluded to is pretty bland. The acting is adequate for a B movie of this type. Performances are generally wooden. The model work is very dated. If you watch carefully at the end of the film you will easily notice problems with the scale of the ship as compared to the ocean it is floating in. On the horror level the film is fairly non gory and except for one or two instances of blood there is no offensive violence. Unlike the first two films the nudity in this outing is nonexistent.This is worth a viewing for the Ossario completest but is generally not worth seeking out otherwise. The disc also contains the original theatrical trailer, promotional materials for its American release as Horror of the Zombies, and a stills gallery.",The Ghost Galleon

What he has released is a very different film, with a much different feel.  Gone is the clastrophobic feeling of the movie.  This is Star Wars rewriting all over again.  Can't say I'm suprised by this.  Lucas seems to be the only director out there that forces only one edition on us, while basically acting like the old versions don't exist anymore.  Lucas doesnt realize that he is already hated by most of his original fans for what he has done with Star Wars and now THX too.My personal opinion based only on my impressions of Lucas's rather narrow-focused mind, is that Howard the Duck, both loved and hated, will never make its way onto DVD only because Lucas doesn't want to associate himself with it anymore.Lucas may be a wealthy man, but he's no Jedi Master.",N/A

Out of his league had a lot to do with the other aspects of her life - not just her looks.  That was just completely glossed over in the movie.  That he makes her laugh is pretty much all it had going for it - or for him.I think the main problem I had with the movie was the last 1/2 hour or so.  The whole airport scene at the end wasn't funny at all.  I listened to the director's commentary and he said that they took ""liberties"" with what would really happen in an airport (security I mean).  Really?  No!?  The problem with some movies is that when they take you too far out of what is possible or real - you basically leave the story and the movie.  The movie is supposed to get you involved and immersed (at least a good one does) so when crazy things (that are NOT funny) happen - it just takes you out of the movie.So the ending was just so slap stickish (it was meant to be) that is was just silly.  This reminded me of a mystery dinner theater we went to.  A lot of the ""acting"" was to have the actors run around the dinner area chasing each other.

1301441,"When you see the headline actors here as being Tina Fey and Steve Carell, you think, ""Man, this one's gonna be hilarious."" You couldn't be more wrong. Tina Fey's obnoxious approach to comedy is usually right on the button, and Steve Carell (from the comedy perspective) can be hit or miss.  Hit - ""40-Year Old Virgin"" and ""Anchorman.""  Miss - ""Dan In Real Life"" and ""Get Smart.""This movie couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do. Should it be a suspense film, or should it be a comedy? Should it be a comedy/suspense film? Answer: None of the above. Date Night tried too hard to be funny with a storyline that was fighting to disallow comedy from the word ""Go."" The punchlines that forced their way into the dialogue from time to time seemed out of place and contrived. If you're going to have a comedy that involves suspense, maybe you should consider having some bumbling idiots as bad guys or, at the very least, characters with some sense of derivative humor to offset the seriousness of the film, which, in turn, would make this a flick for the comedy/suspense genre. The bad guys here were straight and unfunny.Steve and Tina had a couple of semi-amusing one-liners, but, for the most part, their characters were boring and underdeveloped in an already compromised film, and there was practically nothing they could do, given their highly-regarded comedic talents, to pull this movie from the dregs it was bound to drudge in from the start.Here's an idea: If you're going to make a comedy...make a comedy. This movie was too serious to be funny. As my two-year-old daughter would say, ""Ucky!""",N/A
825833,"This movie misses part of the importance of the original.  Some of the cast is good, but one or two play bad teeny-boppers with 2-dimensional minds.  Yes, this movie is gory, especially this unrated version which is all I've seen.  Yet, it doesn't really compare to the things that made the original Romero film great.  Lately, the movie industry seems to turn out a lot of ""highly fueled, action-packed"" remakes of great films, and I don't know why.  Admittedly, this movie isn't very bad, but I was disappointed this movie was remade at all.  The best part of this remake might have been getting sickened watching a guy with a chainsaw accidentally falling on a girl and cutting her in half when the driver overturns the van in a get-away scene.  I don't see a point here.The original Romero flick had a point.  It was nightmarish and a statement about American consumerism, and a black comedy towards our society.  It also has superb editing, like that of a Sam Peckinpah film.  The zombies in the original don't run around like an action film, they walk like entranced mall shoppers; which is the way we ""zombified"" people look when we're at the mall ourselves.  It doesn't matter if it looked SILLY or even dated.  The horror partly derives out of that.  It makes little sense to hype it.Why REmake a great film??  Can anybody explain this so other people understand?  The ONLY great thing ""remakes"" (of great films) do is come to home video, so the original good movie gets released to DVD (or re-released with a new authoritative DVD as in this case), and then I can go BUY THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC!  The only time movie people should ever remake a film is if the original wasn't very good, but has potential.  Hitchcock remade his own film, as did Cecil B. DeMille, which is more like correcting an error.  ""Dawn"" did not need to be remade!  Romero did fine!  The Romero Exception is ""Night Of the Living Dead"" because Romero's SFX makeup/prothetics man, Tom Savini who worked on all three Romero classics, directed the new one and it is an interesting change from the classic that stood on its own.Maybe I'm being a little harsh.  Some of it was memorable.  But, I'm not grateful.Romero is a competent filmmaker with some ability.  Why can't he get the budget he wants?  Why didn't those idiots who produced those terrible Resident Evil films let Romero direct their project?  Maybe making money is something I shouldn't sneer at, but unless I'm a lain-brain twit, I should want some return on the money I spend.  I can go see any slam-bang action film any day of the week, but I can't always find a film with intellectual stimulation and presence.  They should have given Resident Evil to Romero and begged him to stay rather than cave to the politics of the franchise ownership who know nothing of making movies.  The reason to get Romero is not because he will do what they say, but because you can trust him to follow his conscience.  When you get Romero, you have an interesting movie.  I point to the latest Resident Evil Apocalypse and rest my case.",Dawn of the Dead

1438319,"Before watching The Grace Card, I heard several very good reviews about it. Everyone who watched it seemed to think it was a very profound and well done movie of faith. Needless to say, I was excited to watch the movie and had high(er) expectations.The Pros:-The cinematography as a whole is not bad. For the most part, the shots were good.-The actor who played Mac (the white male cop, main protagonist) was the best actor in the movie. However, even he had some moments that were ""cringe worthy"".-The anger and frustration over finances in the home were spot on.The Cons:-The acting. ...Enough said.-The dialogue was clunky in several places.-Sometimes, the choices of scenes were more of a distraction than helping the story. In several cases the choice to put in a scene jolted you out of the flow of the story.-Overall, there was a feeling to the film that didn't sit right with me and those watching it with me. It's hard to describe. It's like you wished you had never watched the movie and never, ever want to watch it again. But it's more than that. It leaves a bad feeling with you for awhile. Thankfully, God isn't a God who wants you to be in that state and lifts you out of it!-There were faulty theories and strange comments that were rather disturbing. One scene/line in particular was at the end of the movie when a member of Sam's (the black male cop, main protagonist, pastor) church said to the rest of the congregation -about Sam-, ""Welcome him back, he's our healer, Pastor Sam!"" Whether you are Christian or not, that statement is very creepy. If you are Christian you'll know that the phrase contradicts everything in the Bible.-The movie, which is supposed to be a movie of God's grace and faith in Jesus, fell short in that area. Although it had a moment of repentance and two or three characters were ""Christians"", it really lacked God and having a relationship with Him. It was disappointing to see that the pastor/cop, Sam, became a pastor of a church because he thought it was the thing he was supposed to do and thought it was success to make ""his"" church bigger. He suffers from dissatisfaction in that he can't make things happen in the church. First of all, Sam shouldn't have become a pastor unless God specifically told him to- not because it seemed like the best thing for a good Christian guy, or the right thing to do. Second, he- as many real life pastors today- missed the fact that it's not about a bigger church attendance and it's not a pastor's job to make a mega-church. The job of the pastor is to shepard the people and to show God's heart. You do what God tells you to do and He'll bring the increase.Lastly, Sam never recognized the fact that the source of his dissatisfaction was that he needed a RELATIONSHIP with God and not a distant mutual acquaintance. He never realized that maybe he WASN'T supposed to be a pastor. Sam should have taken a hiatus from ministry until he knew that God wanted him to go back or to quit being a minister.Perhaps the real reason why this movie didn't make the cut is a combination of the bad feeling of the film, the lack of Jesus' saving grace, the odd comments and central theme of human grace and human healing.",N/A

56328,"The main reason for reviewing this is simply backlog; I do enjoy Van Damme's oeuvre for the high comedies that they are, but this film really wasn't much of an improvement over 'Cyborg', which was possibly the worst film ever made (yes, that includes 'Hudson Hawk').Prior to release, Van Damme had been going around saying it will be a pure action film, returning to his 'Bloodsport' roots.  I wish.  For $20 million dollars cheaper, 'Bloodsport' makes 'the Quest' look like 'Best of the Best IV'.For starters, it's rated PG-13, so the action can't be all out--something we don't have to worry about when his films are rated 'R.'  Secondly, what little fighting there is only surfaces in the last 25 minutes of the film.  While as a director, Van Damme doesn't make many resolutely bone-headed mistakes, he should stay away from vanity projects like this one.The film itself is quite boring, and while it is amusing to see Roger Moore pick up his paycheck and run (it's been a hard life since 'View to a Kill'), nothing merits buying this on DVD.",N/A

1390808,"The shallow merits of The Tourist do little to remedy its paper-thin characterization, forgettable score, mismatched actors, and chronic identity crisis.  It is appropriately titled, however, in that the plot was no doubt contrived on a $14 coffee coaster in San Marco while the cast 'toured' Venice.  Meanwhile, the director incorporated a few mildly humorous segments of (PJ clad) Depp braving the Hotel Deniali rooftop, and runway model Jolie slaloming Venetian 'campos' like an Energizer powered Barbie doll.  The drum and French poodle were all that was missing.  Furthermore, the unremarkable script was saturated with clich&eacute;s and predictable eventualities, which conspired to poison the already non-existent chemistry between Depp and Jolie.  Even worse, the attempted blend of comedy, espionage, and Summertime(esque) romance only cannibalized its individual components and added to the confusion.  The effect was glitz and kitsch, not glamour and thrill.  The film also failed to showcase those subtle elements that make Venice the most awe-inspiringly romantic city in the world.  The result is a ""cinematic experience"" that utilized for its backgrounds shop-bought Venetian postcards.To be fair, there were a few witty lines like the ""ravenous/ravishing"" pre-dinner exchange.  Good stuff.  Had they been faithful to this lighthearted, comedic prescription and axed the absurd spy vs. spy subplot, the movie would have been more memorable.  Ironically, Timothy Dalton's minor role--owing to his ageless appearance and former work as 007--seemed to steal the show.If you're in the mood for a believable romance that truly captures the essence/charm of Venice, go rent David Lean's Summertime, starring Katherine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi.",N/A
1403446,"Check out the full review at Metal Arcade DOT NetBe aware that this review may contain some spoilers. DC Comics' Green Lantern makes his long awaited debut on the big screen. So how did it pan out?Not too great. I went into this movie with very low expectations based on the bad word of mouth it had been receiving. The movie never blew away those low expectations, either.Ryan Reynolds stars in this Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) directed, effects driven romp as Hal Jordan, the first ever human chosen to join the ranks of the Green Lantern Corps.Hal is a reckless, cocky pilot when the movie starts, and he seems to have pissed off most of the people in his life who care about him. Shortly after an accident causes him to lose his job, Hal encounters a dying alien named Abin Sur, who passes the Green Lantern torch to him before he dies, saying that the ring chose him as his successor. A Green Lantern must be responsible and fearless, and so Hal thinks that the ring has made a big mistake in choosing him.After the ring is bonded to him, Hal is sent to the Lantern's home world of Oa. It is there that he meets Sinestro, a great warrior who is resentful of Hal, whom he believes is unworthy of the legendary Abin Sur's ring. He is also greeted by Kilowog (Michael Clarke Duncan), a giant beast of a drill instructor, and the intellectual Tomar-Re (Geoffrey Rush). He is beaten down by Kilowog's harsh training and Sinestro's down-talking, and after being pushed too far, he quits, saying that the ring made a mistake in choosing him.Back on Earth, Hector Hammond (played by a nigh-unrecognizable Peter Skarsgaard), a highly intelligent professor and son of a senator (Tim Robbins), is visited by the government, who wants him to study the alien Abin Sur's body. While examining the body, he is infected by the fear energy that killed Abin Sur, by way of Parallax, a dumb looking Galactus ripoff, fueled by terrible CGI. Hal must overcome his fears of the past, his memories of his dead father's terrible plane crash, and now Hector and Galactus... erm, Parallax, if he's to make Sinestro proud and live up to his hype as a Lantern.The movie itself, however, far from lives up to its hype. With a director like Martin Campbell, who revitalized the aging James Bond franchise, you would think the movie was in good hands. However, this movie is just one more in the long line of 3-D driven special effects spectacles that try to cover up the film's lack of true substance and story. As you could probably tell from my long winded retelling of the film's setup, the story is terribly confusing, with too much going on, too many characters and too much CGI to distract you. This is DC's version of X-Men: The Last Stand (an arguably better movie).The CGI in the movie ranges from terrible to amazing. The time spent on the planet Oa, home of the Lanterns, is arguably the most well done, with thousands of cool looking alien species serving as Corps members and a beautiful skyline. Hal's training on Oa is by far the most interesting visually and story-wise. It's a shame Hal's time on Oa only accounts for about 15 minutes of this movie.Once Hector Hammond makes his debut as a dumb looking giant-headed, ugly ass guy in a wheelchair, the film becomes plain laughable. His character is far from intimidating, and I can't understand why they decided to put him in the movie. Near the end of the film he reveals his feelings for Hal's girl Carol (Blake Lively) and how he's despised Hal since they were kids- which seems thrown in at the last minute since the film makes no mention that they all grew up together. Sarsgaard's performance is hammy and terrible, and you just want his character to die a horrible death form the moment you see him. You'll understand once you see the film- he pretty much just wastes all the time he was onscreen, which could have been much better served on the awesome looking planet Oa.Likewise, the main villain, Parallax, is dumb, stupid looking, and not as intimidating as everyone in the movie makes him out to be. The final confrontation between Hal and this absurd looking villain could have been a great opportunity to showcase the cool looking ranks of the Green Lantern Corps, but I guess they ran out of CGI money there or something, because even Parallax himself looks like he was created by a budget, basement CGI team normally used for Sy-Fi channel garbage.Some people were complaining about Ryan Reynolds being cast in the role of Hal Jordan, but he is bar none the best thing in the movie. He is the only character you actually care about, and his acting ability and charisma are the only thing keeping this film from being totally unwatchable. Blake Lively is pretty good in her role, which doesn't give her much to do besides look pretty and have one cool Top-Gun style flight sequence in the beginning of the film.There are so many things wrong with this movie that I can't detail them all, even in this now close to 1000 word review. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, however Hal Jordan, one of DC's few well-respected characters, deserved much better. As it stands, Batman is still the only DC character with movies worthy of his comic pedigree, and that's a real shame.",Green Lantern

This is a very dumb movie, but the special effects are a delight, and we were having such a good time watching them when -- the wolves showed up.  Okay.  Poorly animated.  Typical Red-Riding Hood vicious.  No clue on the part of the writers that a trio of tame zoo wolves would see people as part of their pack -- and probably alpha members of that pack -- rather than as food.  And why would wolves bother eating live people when there were piles of dead human flesh all over the place?  These domestic howls would have been more likely to run up to the humans they found with their tails and heads down, whimpering, ""Feed us!  Feed us!""  And the wolf animation was... well, in 1987, it would have been forgiveable.  But now?  There's no excuse for this sort of second-string slop.  I really do take it personally when a film obviously sniffs, ""Well, that's good enough for YOU -- you don't know any better.""

778802,"I got really excited when first hearing about this movie.  It's not every day one stumbles across an odd pairing of two of their favorite pastimes, in my case horror films and snowboarding.  Upon examining the DVD box at the rental store however my enthusiasm dimmed somewhat as it become obvious to me just what kind of horror film this was going to be: a straight-to-vid dime-a-dozen self-referential cookie cutter slasher film.  The sort of horror film that's pumped out by studios such as Fox Home Entertainment and Artisan Entertainment with inhuman regularity and readily available at your local chain video store since it contains very little amounts of graphic gore and lots of pretty faces who unfortunately can't act their way out of paper bags.The ""Rocky Summit"" was a popular family-owned ski resort that has been closed for many years now due to an ugly incident where three drunk snowboarders inadvertently led a young girl to her death by making her ski straight into a tree.  The ski resort went bankrupt but the property was bought by a rich investor, Mr. Van Arts.  His daughter Kimberly decides to round up a few of her friends and head out to the abandoned resort for a weekend of partying and ""Shredding"", as the young daredevils like to put it.  Unbeknownst to them a maniac is on the loose in the resort, someone who despises snowboarders and hasn't forgotten about the murder of the little girl several years ago.Anyone considering renting this film strictly for snowboarding elements should definitely reconsider as the film has next to no snowboarding maneuvers, just a gang of teenagers lazily cruising down the slopes.  There is one member of the gang named Kurk who apparently won a high-profile local context and who is a runner-up to qualify for the next Olympics.  Curious then that in a two-minute demo the only tricks he is able to pull are a couple of 540's and a bunch of uninspired tail grabs.  Obviously the filmmakers didn't spend too much money on trying to attract quality stunt doubles.  Besides the lack of tricks there are stereotypes about the sport in this movie that will make any experienced rider cringe and grit their teeth such as juvenile pop-punk music playing throughout, a horde of product plugs(everyone in the movie wears ""Dragon"" snowboard goggles even the killer who supposedly hates everything associated with the sport) and of course the requisite hyperactive tweenie geek who keeps uttering outdated lingo like ""gnarly"", ""rad"" and can't finish a sentence without uttering the word ""dude"" whether he is speaking to someone male or female.There are a couple of positives that I must point out however.  Shot on location in Kellogg, Idaho, the viewer is treated to stunning mountain locales.  When the snow falls, we know that it's real.  And of course there's also plenty of eye-candy although the film's quite conservative in the nudity department.  Amazingly, Shredder starts off quite promisingly.  We are treated to a high-speed chase down the slopes, a snowboarder on the run from the maniac killer.  The snowboarder dies a gruesome and gory death in very creative fashion.  Then the opening credits roll and that's the end of the gore, really.  Many of the murders are off screen and very little blood is shown, even when someone's head is chopped right off their neck.  Some of the scenes are cheesy beyond belief, especially since the tone of the film is serious.  It's too bad because I liked the concept but Shredder managed to disappoint both the snowboard and slasher fan in me.",N/A
1123851,"Like the central protagonist, this 2007 movie is a misbegotten mess. Making his directorial debut, actor Justin Theroux gets carried away with every film school trick in the book with self-conscious camerawork, annoying jump cuts and a music soundtrack that apparently has to comment on every scene. With a strangely cryptic first-time screenplay by David Bromberg, the movie boasts an impressive cast that includes Tom Wilkinson and Dianne Wiest, but it asks us to empathize with an obsessive-compulsive misanthrope whose actions alienate everyone around him. The ploy is too challenging since the character is more cruel than unfiltered, and his relentless bitterness rarely crackles with the wit necessary to get away with such boorish behavior. Moreover, subsequent attempts to humanize him feel increasingly contrived as the story progresses.The story revolves around Henry Roth, a prickly, phobic children's book author (an intentionally ironic profession for such an uncaring jerk) who bonds only with his longtime collaborator, a curmudgeonly illustrator named Rudy. They finally achieve success with a book about Marty the Beaver's campaign to save Christmas, but then Rudy dies. Henry's poker-faced editor, Arthur Planck, wants a sequel and consequently hires a young artist named Lucy to take Rudy's place. Lucy has her share of problems - a mother who is also her landlord and willing to evict her, and an errant lover named Jeremy who wants her back after dumping her. The movie's title is derived from the dedication to Lucy in Jeremy's about-to-be-published book. Motivated by a large bonus offered by Planck, Lucy is willing to subject herself to Henry's nasty comments, but of course, a romance develops. This is where the film falters badly as the love story is sketchily developed with little discernible chemistry between the two stars.The cast provides whatever redeeming value the film has. The usually audacious Billy Crudup does what he can as Henry, but it's an uphill battle. Better here than in last year's execrableBecause I Said So, Mandy Moore brings a certain poignancy to her scenes, but her downbeat character is so depressing that the only logical response to their romance is indifference. Wilkinson easily steals his scenes as Rudy both pre- and post-mortem, while Bob Balaban plays Planck in his typically low-key fashion. Wiest plays Lucy's mother in just a couple of tersely acted scenes, while Amy Sedaris, Peter Bogdanovich, Christine Taylor and Bobby Cannavale show up in cameos. The 2008 DVD is bereft of any extras, not even the theatrical trailer, which gives you an indication of what the studio thought of its prospects.",Dedication

1084130,"It's not completely awful, but it doesn't quite work, either. The ending is startling in the way it crashes to an abrupt, anti-climactic, well-that-wraps-it-up-and-thank-you-for-coming dive for the final frame; all the more startling because the rest of the movie tended to plod along. The robots and zombies are traditionally cheesy (as usual, the simple solution is to outrun them, which is trivial to manage, but too rarely accomplished by our hapless heroes). And despite the title, if you're hoping for screaming British babes in desperate circumstances, this is very much the wrong movie. No babes, and really very little screaming.If you have popcorn, and other viewers to help you cope with the plodding moments (and there are many), you might manage occasional flashes of amused oh-that's-so-bad, but there's no real suspense to be had here, and it's hard to care about any of the characters. The acting is, well, I've seen worse. (I've seen Manos, after all.)Still, a step up from Cat Women of the Moon, Teenager from Outer Space, and the frighteningly awful Astounding She Monster.",Chosen Survivors / The Earth Dies Screaming
715627,"Fans of Bigfoot movies will probably like this one, but it is not in the least bit scary and yes the bigfoot creature does look just like a man in a suite.Essentially ""Creature From Black Lake"" is about two young anthropologists who are given a grant to go look for a bigfoot type creature in Louisiana. Along the way there is lots of corny segments involving girls and a run-in with the law. In the end they manage to track down bigfoot and end up in a bid for survival.There is really only one good thing about this movie - Dean Cundy does a great job of the cinematography. Apart from that it is extremely cheesy and is only for bigfoot completists that must have everything. If you want to see a good cheesy Bigfoot movie then see ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" instead.",N/A
664604,"I just watched this movie for the second time, in many, many years. I first saw it when it first came out, and I remember I did not like it back then. I recently found out a 4th and 5th installment where made, so I decided to check out the first 3 to refresh my memory before checking out 4 & 5. Well, I only recalled bits and pieces, but yup, same conclusion as all those years ago when I first saw it. This time around, some army guys are experimenting with the zombie chemicals from the barrels (as in the barrels from the first two movies). One of the scientists on the team's on steals his security card and breaks into the facility with his girlfriend to find out what they are doing there. They discover his father is using the chemical to bring back the dead, and to experiment on a way to destroy them when they do reanimate.The son ends up having an argument with his father, and he runs away with his girlfriend on his motorbike. However, they have a bike accident that kills his girlfriend. And in desperation he takes her body to the facility and brings her back using the zombie chemical. Now she is back, but she is a zombie, and she too wants brains. And anyone she bites, will become a zombie too.Out of all the 4 ROTLD movies, this one is my least favorite. That's including parts 4 & 5. In each of the movies, there are some pretty lame scenes and acting, but this one seems to take the cake. Mostly it comes from the starring zombie role of whomever she is playing her. She really does and acts in some pretty nauseating ways. Some say this was the goriest version of the 5 movies. But you know what, I don't care, gore does not make a movie great. This one's ending was the worst of them all too. Even tho it stayed more truer to the first two movies then the next two, it still had moments of WTF about it. Why bother to do this, only to end up like this and that, seeing the movie for yourself, you will understand what I mean by that.In my collection, sometimes I like to just have all the movies to complete a collection, but sometimes I make an exception, and I would never have bothered to purchase Robocop 3 or Police Academy 7 had they not come in box sets with all the movies. If the Return of the Living Dead came in a box set, I would have bought it, provided it contained all 5 movies, or parts 2 to 5 or whatever, but these movies are all individual, and I am glad I did not pay money for this 3rd movie with it's horrible made in the early 90's stupid futureistic-wanna-be silo facilities with fluorescent stage lighting with Star Trek sliding doors all the place that are supposed to be top secret facilities. Also in this film, you have come to expect to see zombies come back from the dead, in bone and flesh form, but this movie failed to bring anyone dead back apart from the main girl. Everyone else was just infected by a bite and the best you get is a guy with his dead on his exposed spine. It really felt like they had a small budget and this film was not all it could have been visually. And again, they really needed some better actors, most where just annoying and did not take their roles serious enough to pull off a great B-grade horror comedy.",N/A

OK, I'll give it a shot, plus I heard all these rave reviews about it. Boy was I in for an unpleasant surprise. The acting was horrible and most of the characters were so ridiculous that I couldn't even take them seriously. This is one of those films that is unintentionally funny. All kidding aside, this is literally how I think a 13 year old would visualize a good action/drama film.

After hearing countless positive reviews about this movie I decided to see for myself what all the hype was about.  In a world of countless bad romantic dramady's I was expecting Say Anything to be a moving unsentimetal view of a new relationship.  This is little more than your standard chick flick.  Not to say that this is Katherine Heigle chick flick bad,  but its also not a very original depiction of a new budding romance.  Thier were scenes in this movie that made me cringe because of its cornyness.  This would all be fine if I were a 17 year old girl but I happen to be a 30 year old man,  and when a movie gets this much acclaim it should speak to all demographics.

1678643,"A mere seventeen episodes constitutes the entirety of Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series. As slight as that sounds, I found this slim three-disc set to be an overdose of sub-Laverne and Shirley unfunniness, songs that would never threaten and hit lists during any era, supporting characters not even their own mothers could love, and storylines so bereft of originality the second to last episode actually resorted to using Happy Days flashbacks!Do I sound unnecessarily harsh? If so, it's because I'm pissed off at how little apparent interest creator Garry Marshall and company had in delivering a series worth watching. First, there's the concept: Joanie and Chachi decide to chase their dreams and sing with a band, playing nightly at Delvecchio's restaurant. Think about that for a moment&#8230;When you go out for a nice Italian dinner, do you really want a rock group thrashing away at songs you've never heard before, and being sung by a man with a tin throat? Scott Baio is many things&#8212;incredibly charming, handsome, and when given the chance, a fine actor&#8212;but musical is not one of them!And then, there's the rest of &#34;the band,&#34; who never actually rate a name. On bass guitar is Chachi's cousin Annette (Winifred Freedman); a cute, sweet and (slightly) chubby girl who gets routinely pelted with fat and ugly jokes. Nice, right? Annette's brother Mario (Derrel Maury) plays keyboards; a fairly good looking&#8212;if somewhat anonymous&#8212;kid, distinguished only by his pork pie hat. Finally, there's drummer Bingo (Robert Pierce), who wears Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts, has a bushy blond perm, and speaks entirely in non-sequiturs, sounding just like Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. That's right, he's a &#34;surfer dude&#34;&#8230;in Chicago.You want comedy? Here's a sample of what passes for witty repartee.Al: &#34;Bingo, listen, the band is late again. Now, we can't wait forever. Isn't there something you can do?&#34;Bingo: &#34;If you could get me a bowl of cereal, I can pick out the riboflavin.&#34;Here's more.(Chachi is clearing tables at the restaurant when he sees Joanie's ex-boyfriend enter, and take a seat. Hoping to avoid a confrontation, Chachi darts behind the bar, where Mario is standing, and crouches down next to him.)Mario: &#34;You know, Chachi, when you crouch down like that, you're the exact height as my grandmother.&#34;Unfortunately, Paramount's DVD presentation of Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series suits the middling-to-awful material all too well. The 1.33:1 standard def full frame image looks pretty good, but many of the episodes suffer from flicker at the top of the frame, and the pilot appears to have taken a bit of a beating (watchable, but roughed-up). The Dolby 2.0 Mono audio is more successful, clearly amplifying Mr. Baio's vocal performances, so beware. (Note: According to Mr. Todd Fuller, founder of the excellent Sitcoms Online website, several episodes have had musical numbers edited out!) Subtitles have been provided, but nothing else, which is curious, as all the major cast members, Marshall, and many of the show's runners are still among the living. Again, that seeming total lack of interest on their part.Lest I leave you with the impression that Joanie Loves Chachi was among the very worst endeavors in TV series history, I feel obligated to mention there were some obviously talented performers involved (who couldn't love Molinaro and Travolta?). But somehow their efforts were squandered or taken for granted, if not altogether ignored. I'm speaking specifically of Erin Moran. By the time this series bowed, the then twenty one year old actress was a fifteen year showbiz veteran, who'd grown from a freckled tomboy into a stunningly beautiful woman with an incredible singing voice. In this critic's humble opinion, no bigger mistake was made by the spin-off's producers than their decision to make Moran a junior partner in the musical element of the series. Check out her amazing slow-burn rendition of early '60s classic &#34;He's So Fine&#34; at the end of the episode &#34;Term Paper.&#34; It'll blow your mind.Judge P.S.

958915,"Why this movie is an award winner I don't know, and can't imagine.  Its production quality is first rate, but the values in it are horrible from a traditional values point of view.  The Thief Lord is a son of a wealthy family that steals.  In a way, he is a fifteen year old Robin Hood.  It isn't made clear what he does with the money, except that he seems to support a bunch or orphans and runaway kids.  There is a bit of fantasy in the story as a magical merry-go-around turns kids into adults and adults into kids.  If parents show this movie to their kids, there is much to discuss.  I sometimes say that nobody is completely useless; they can always be used as a bad example.  I'd say the same about this movie - it isn't completely useless, parents can point out all these kids are doing wrong or immorally.  However, there are so many great movies with good traditional values that it seems pointless to waste time on one such as this.  There are even a few swear words in the movie.","Thief Lord, The"
225250,"""The Omen"" is a supposedly scary film released in the late '70s which kicked off what was supposed to be a four-part franchise detailing the life of Damien, who we meet in this first movie.The movie's plot is rather lame: Gregory Peck, playing an ambassador, is convinced by a priest to switch his wife's stillborn (as far as he knows) baby with another baby, born June 6th at 6 a.m. Peck raises the baby as his own. Life goes on, but on Damien's 5th birthday, things occur that slowly convince Peck that his little devil actually is the Antichrist. The rest of the film details Peck's quest to learn more about Damien and questioning whether his precious little baby boy could actually be the spawn of Satan.If this sounds interesting, trust me it is not. It's all pieced together with choir music of the damned, as well as some hammy overacting, mostly from the maid and a Father who travels all the way from Italy to warn Peck of his son's quest. There's also some points about Peck's wife and her feelings toward the baby, but it's ignored later on. The film is about Peck and it belongs to him. I kind of feel sorry for this much-respected actor to appear in this film. Damien, on the other hand, is actually not really in the film that much, and if he is, it's just to stare at a dog or thrash about madly. The scenes of death and horror that occur are standard - there's the beheading, the flailing jump out a window, and such. And the whole plot seems tame compared to today.

731336,"To say I like Madonna in film (and her second flat attempt to copy an already well-established story, the first being ""Evita"") is to also say that I would rather prefer to eat McDonalds' artifical ""food"" than to sit at a fine restaurant and eat a well-prepared 5-course dinner.I would love to give you a point by point description of how sad, boring, drawn-out and NON-feminist this movie is as opposed to Lina Wertmuller's fantastic expositive view on male and female roles, society, and love.Madonna is truly a bitch in this disaster, and the only saving grace is given by the somewhat haphazard attempt to act by her co-star, Giancarlo Giannini lookalike (and son) Adriano. She gives him no real room to stretch out and show any kind of real emotion, and he ends up looking as wooden as the luxury boat they argue on.I'm disappointed once again by her performance, which shows about as much growth as any 4th grader in their first leading role could.I want to go on, and normally I do, but I'm going to leave you with this one thought:The video? Crystal clear, and the island they are deserted on is wonderfully treated - swaying hot tropical jungles, almost white sandy beaches, perfect for two people to connect, both eotionally and sexually if they were deserted and knew that maybe one day they would be rescued.The audio? Perfect as well.The movie, the acting, the lack of real substance and horrible non-ending that is nowhere near the original ending and so forced my arm hurt from being twisted so badly? I almost threw up in my mouth a little.Internationally, Madonna can do no wrong. I expect that in the UK she is as revered as another of our USA saints, Michael Jackson. Here in America? Not so much. Her star has dropped way off the charts a long time ago.I give this disaster (which, after an abysmal showing in the U.S. theaters, the ""unrated"" U.K. version of the film was released directly to DVD worldwide) 2 stars at best.Yuk.I feel so dirty having reviewed this I'm immediately watching the original, which has a wonderful dry sexual spirit to it.Madonna should NOT quit her day job.",Swept Away
1257189,"Clive Owen is the greatest thing to come along in the Leading Man Department since George Clooney, and, come to think of it, Duplicity is a movie that would very much like to recapture the spark of that classic Clooney vehicle Out of Sight. Julia Roberts, on the other hand, is no Jennifer Lopez. Roberts has aged into a technically competent but utterly uncharismatic actress, and she plays an essentially unattractive character here unattractively. It's a role that really needed some of that old Roberts sparkle, but most of the time, she just seems old. The ultimate selling-point for this movie, then, is Tony Gilroy's script. Gilroy wants us awfully to see how clever he is, but this tale of double-crossing double agents really just plays like an overlong episode of the old TV series Alias, but funnier. By the time Duplicity lurches to its rather logically fuzzy conclusion, the final twist isn't nearly as surprising as Gilroy thinks it is. As a director, meanwhile, Gilroy wants awfully to be Steven Soderbergh, even resorting to split-screen devices and non-chronological narrative elements. But he just doesn't have Soderbergh's frisson. Among the supporting players, Tom Wilkinson is utterly wasted, while Paul Giamatti (although a little bit hammy and more than a little too young for the role he's playing) continues to demonstrate why he's his generation's finest character actor. Movies come alive when his funny mug comes on screen.",Duplicity

It shows this place for what it is...a gorgeous, culturally diverse, upscale city.  The exterior shots show off my hometown wonderfully (and it all really looks like that, except we don't have a restaurant on the roof of the Times building).The setting and the eclectic soundtrack are the best things in it.There are some wonderful actors trying their best with almost no script that matters (although Billy Dee seems half-asleep a lot of the time).Every reaction shot is at least twice as long as it needs to be, and most scenes are, too. It's one very slow hour and a half.My favorite scene is when a stunned, disoriented Billy Dee wanders into Melvins BBQ Place. After one of the locals tries cheerily to figure out what he wants or where is trying to go,  and is met with stares and gibberish--the local man switches to deep concern: ""Can I give you a ride someplace, man?""

While Ian McKellen's Richard is cold-blooded and sly, he is more comical than menacing. The humor he puts into his role does not seem to match the more serious portrayals of the other characters.  Annette Bening, even with an American accent, is spectacular as the strong-willed Queen Elizabeth. Likewise, Robert Downey Jr. is forceful but grossly underused as the queen's brother Rivers: he really deserves a Shakespearean film of his own. Maggie Smith has a small part as Richard's mother that she makes the most of despite the fact that she and Ian McKellan seem too close in age to be a mother and son. Kristin Scott Thomas, as Richard's wife, stands around and looks gorgeous, but delivering her lines while smoking a cigarette doesn't make her a great actress.

The voice acting is OK but it never seems to truely fit in with the actions, movements, or emotions of the CGI characters on screen. I guess my greatest issue with this movie is that F.F.7 for the PS1 had such an epic and sweeping storyline that Advent Children feels so small and pointless compared to the great storytelling that inspired it. The bonus materials on Disc 2 are just OK with nothing truely amazing to mention. I know that a large group of Final Fantasy fans are ready to buy this DVD by the thousands, and they should.
